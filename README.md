# Western Water Datahub

The Wester Water Datahub (WWDH) is an implementation of the [OGC API](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/) suite of standards, enabling access to water data from various sources through a unified interface. It is designed to enhance data interoperability, accessibility, and discoverability across multiple water data platforms.

This project is a collaboration between the United States Beaureu of Reclamation, the Center for Geospatial Solutions, and Wester States Water Council.

## Source Systems

The interface consolidates access to multiple water data sources, offering a standardized API pattern to retrieve information from different systems. The sources are listed below:

| Data Source | Variables                                                 | OGC API Format | Source URL Link                                                                          |

## Getting Started

In both development and containerized deployments, the server can be accessed at `http://localhost:5005`

### Local Development

- Spin up the redis db using `docker compose up -d`
- To install dependencies run `make deps`
  - We use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management and thus you should have it installed
- To run the server run: `make dev`
- To run tests run: `make test`

### Containerized Deployment

The following command will spin up all infrastructure for a containerized deployment and build both the server and UI as docker images

```bash
docker compose --profile production up
```

(Note: in production we deploy the pygeoapi server as a container on cloud run as defined by the [cloudbuild.yaml](./cloudbuild.yaml) file)
