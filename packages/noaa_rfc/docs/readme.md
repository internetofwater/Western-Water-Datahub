There is not natively a single API for this data. Rather we reverse engineer the frontend code [here](https://www.cbrfc.noaa.gov/wsup/graph/west/map/esp_map.js) which compromises [this map](https://www.cbrfc.noaa.gov/wsup/graph/west/map/esp_map.html). This can be used to create an OGC API features endpoint. Finally, there may be duplicate identifiers in this dataset due to the fact that a single monitoring location can have multiple forecasts. To fix this, all forecasts are put on the same feature.
