This directory contains all code for USACE as well as the the associated scripts for generating static metadata, 30 year averages, and a static json which maps ids from the national inventory of dams to the [GRanD database](https://www.globaldamwatch.org/grand).

To use this you need to have both a geopackage for the dams in the GRanD database and a geopackage for the dams in the NID.

To get these geopackages run the commands in the [makefile](./makefile).
