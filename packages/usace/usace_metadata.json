    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nA Periodic Assessment of Conant Brook Dam and Dike was made in 2016. That assessment showed that the risk was driven by three different Risk Drivers.  The first was internal erosion of the embankment next to the left spillway training wall.  The risk here is considered because this area of the dam has never been loaded, so we don't have performance history.  But, the design of the dam has several features that mitigate the possibility, including very strict compaction requirements during construction and a gently battered spillway training wall.  The design flood would only load this area for about 2 to 3 hours, which would not likely be enough time to develop a crack through the embankment.  This, the chance of this failure is considered remote\n\nThe other two risk driving failure modes were overwash erosion leading to headcutting on the dam or the dike.  There are 2 feet of freeboard from the design storm, so the risk from major storms is based on possible waves lapping over the embankments.  We anticipate about 0.2 feet of wave action for about 2 to three hours.  Because of the rock slope protection of the embankment, the chance of this risk driver leading to failure of either the dam or the dike is considered remote.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nConant Brook Dam is staffed full time in conjunction with East Brimfield Dam and Westville Dam by personnel trained in dam safety.  Project staff are in routine contact with downstream communities.  Instruments are reviewed monthly to look for changes in embankment behavior.  During high pools and as requested, the dam is visited by dam safety engineers.",

    "projectDescription": "The US Army Corps of Engineers completed the construction of Sutton Dam in 1960. The project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938. The authorized project purposes include flood risk management, water supply, water quality control, recreation, and fish and wildlife. \n\nSutton Dam is a high hazard potential dam located just one mile upstream of the Town of Sutton in Braxton County, WV. It is situated on the Elk River, about 100 miles above the mouth at the Kanawha River and 160 miles from the confluence of the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers. \n\nThe dam is a straight concrete gravity structure which includes an overflow spillway section at the river channel, two non-overflow sections at the abutments, training walls, and a curved roller bucket at the toe of the overflow section. The dam has a maximum height of 210 feet above streambed and an overall length of 1,178 feet with its highest elevation at (1016.4 ft on NAVD88 Datum). The top width of the dam is 20 feet, and the maximum base width is 195 feet. Normal outflow is through five gated sluices that exit near the toe of the concrete gravity spillway. The maximum sluice gate discharge is 5000 cfs with all gates fully open at a pool of 1015 ft-NGVD29. A spillway is located in the channel section of the dam that is controlled by gages. Spillway discharge is controlled by six Tainter Gates. Design discharge of the spillway is 222,240 cfs which is 2 times Niagara Falls. \n\nSutton dam helps regulate waters coming from the Elk River in the 537 square mile drainage area upstream of the dam. The dam\u2019s primary function is to provide flood risk management all along the Elk River and Kanawha Rivers including many riverfront communities in Braxton, Clay, Kanawha, Putnam, and Mason counties. West Virginia communities that benefit from Sutton Dam include, but are not limited to, Sutton, Gassaway, Charleston, South Charleston, Dunbar, Saint Albans, Nitro, Poca, Winfield, and Point Pleasant.\n\nSutton Dam routinely releases Elk River waters to keep downstream rivers flowing. However, when it is projected that the Elk, Kanawha, or Ohio Rivers may cause flooding, water coming from upstream of the dam is stored until streams and rivers downstream of the dam recede. Typically storm waters can be released in a controlled manner to reduce flood impacts downstream. However, there are rare storms which can cause more rainfall and runoff than Sutton Dam can store safely. When this occurs, the dam\u2019s spillway gates can be raised to release or spill these waters to reduce the chance that the dam could be overtopped. Opening of the spillway gates will result in flooding downstream of the dam but still far less flooding than would have occurred if the dam was not in place. \n\nWhen the dam is not storing flood waters to reduce flood risks downstream, the dam operates to impound water for flood risk management with secondary purposes of recreation, fish and wildlife conservation, and water quality. This lake is raised in the warmer months to support boat access and lowered in the winter months to provide for additional flood storage capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Sutton Dam greatly reduces flood risks downstream, it does not eliminate these\nrisks. Flooding can still occur even if Sutton Dam is operating as designed. There are rare but probable storms, like hurricanes, which cause more rainfall than Sutton Dam can store safely. While hurricanes regularly result in increased precipitation in West Virginia, to affect Sutton Dam, they would have to drop significant rainfall in the Elk River basin which is in the north central part of the state, away from the coast. While this reduces the likelihood of a storm impacting this basin, in some rare occasions, conditions could lead to extreme flows through the spillway which would be about four times as much as Niagara Falls.\n\n\nThe dam\u2019s primary spillway passes these events to keep Sutton Dam from overtopping. When passing these events, flooding is likely in all river-front communities in the Elk and Kanawha River valleys and potentially the Ohio River valley as well. Depending on the amount of water released during these events, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.\n\n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach hillside to hillside quickly and be more than tens of feet deep, depending on the location. In the unlikely event Sutton Dam must pass these extreme waters, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.\n\n\nThe risk associated with a dam failure is considered very low. The most substantial risk is the potential of monolith sliding instability along either a deep-seated failure plane (valley center) or at the concrete rock interface (left abutment) due to erosion of the passive wedge either by spillway discharge or overtopping flow during extreme rain events. For a failure in the valley center near monolith 20, approximately 15 feet of massive sandstone must be eroded downstream of the roller bucket to daylight the critical failure plane. This likelihood is extremely low.\n\n\nWhile very unlikely, this concern with the monolith 20 stability could be realized during the passage of extremely rare storms when flooding is already occurring downstream. However, if the dam were to fail, the flooding downstream would dramatically increase. Specifically, warning times would be reduced, and the volume of water and debris carried by the releases would be more like a tidal wave or tsunami increasing the risk to life and property. In the unlikely event the dam was to fail during one of these extreme events, it is critical that you heed all evacuation orders immediately to protect your life.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Sutton Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities including repairs to one of the spillway gates to eliminate a binding issue, repairing aging instrumentation, and increasing instrumentation to monitor the dam for potential stability issues. USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with USACE staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Waurika Dam in 1977 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Waurika Dam is located on Beaver Creek, which is a tributary of the Red River 6 miles northwest of the town of Waurika, OK. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  Waurika Dam consists of an earth fill embankment, an outlet conduit running through the dam, and an ungated spillway.  The project was constructed with the primary purpose to reduce flooding downstream as a well as irrigation, water supply, water quality control, recreation, and fish and wildlife. Waurika Dam provides water to the cities of Lawton, Duncan, Comanche, Walters, Temple and is the only source of water for Waurika.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in November 2021 and classified the risk associated with Waurika Dam as low.  The risk is primarily driven by 1.) the potential for water to flow over the top of the dam leading to erosion and breach, and 2.) the potential for water seeping through the foundation leading to erosion and breach. Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream, economic impacts and loss of life.  In the event of failure, the most immediate impacts would be to the cities of Waurika and Ryan and then communities along the Red River down to Lake Texoma. Bridges crossing Beaver Creek and the Red River along with key infrastructure along the river from could also be damaged or destroyed.\nThere is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation of the dam which could include large releases through the ungated spillway during a flood.  Although flooding for this scenario would be less than a dam breach scenario, life loss and significant economic impacts could still occur depending on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "Sepulveda Dam is located on the Los Angeles River in the Cities of Encino and Van Nuys, County of Los Angeles, California.  It was authorized to provide flood risk management for the downstream communities and construction was completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in December 1941.  The project is located on the Los Angeles River at the junction of the San Diego(I-405) and Ventura (US-101) freeways.  It is the western most project of those projects making up the Los Angeles County Drainage Area flood control system.  The dam consists of an embankment, outlet works, and concrete spillway that has hydrostatically operated, submersible drum gates.  The purpose of the project is to collect storm runoff from the uncontrolled drainage areas upstream, store it temporarily, and then release to the Los Angeles River at a rate that does not exceed the downstream channel capacity, thus providing the flood damage reduction it was authorized to provide.  The dam is an earth-fill structure with a top of dam length of 15,440 feet and a height of 57 feet above the streambed.  The dam has two methods for releasing water: 1) an outlet works consisting of four gated and four ungated conduits that pass through the dam, 2) spillway with seven automatically/or manually controlled gates.",
    "riskCharSummary": "A risk assessment of the Sepulveda Dam was completed by USACE in 2017.  The risks identified during this study determined the dam to be a moderate risk due to the combination of life, economic, or environmental consequences with likelihood of failure to be unacceptable except in unusual circumstances.  The main factors driving the risk of Sepulveda Dam are erosion of the earthen embankment foundation and mechanical failure of the spillway gates.  The primary consequence locations are Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks and Studio City, California with the population at risk between 576,000 and 640,000.  Economic consequences were estimated to be more than $12 billion.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure USACE is taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises and incorporating any new information into our Emergency Action Plan. USACE closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. USACE is working with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents and schools to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase this monitoring during lake level rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Future risk communication activities include updates to the Emergency Action Plan and coordinating these plans first responders and development of a formal Risk Communication Plan.",

    "projectDescription": "Alum Creek Dam is in Delaware County, Ohio, north of Columbus between I-71 and US 23. Alum Creek flows south joining Big Walnut Creek, near Groveport in southeast Columbus, which joins the Scioto River. Alum Creek was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reduce the flood hazard along Alum and Big Walnut Creeks, the Scioto River, and along the Ohio River. The City of Columbus shared part of the additional project cost for water supply for the metropolitan area. Other benefits of the project are recreation, fish and wildlife management, and downstream water quality. Most of the park is leased to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to operate as a State Park. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages and operates the Visitor Center and the Below Dam Recreation Area, as well as the dam. The dam consists of an earthen embankment with a central gated concrete spillway in the middle, which is used to release water downstream to Alum Creek. Cumulative flood damages prevented are about $129 million over the project life and average about $4.0 million annually.",
    "riskCharSummary": "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Alum Creek Dam in 2024 that characterizes the risk of the project as Very Low, which is U.S. Army Corps of Engineer\u2019s lowest risk category. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although the Alum Creek Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates.  In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam's construction.  \n\nA less likely scenario would be if an extreme flood event were to overtop and erode the earthen embankment portion of the dam.  In this case, if the dam were overtopped for a long enough period of time, it could eventually breach and cause much more water than intended to be released.  Another potential scenario would be if the concrete spillway section were to slide in the downstream direction during a flood.  In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding of Columbus, OH, and other downstream communities. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, Alum Creek Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Alum Creek Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions, and flood fighting materials are stored onsite in case of an emergency.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Cooper Dam in 1991 with the project purpose to provide flood risk management, water supply, environmental regulation, and recreation. Cooper Dam impounds Jim Chapman Lake and is located on the Sulphur River about 4 miles southeast of Cooper, Texas. The project is one of 17 USACE flood control projects in a comprehensive plan for flood control on the Red River below Denison Dam, Texas. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $31 million (adjusted to 2020 dollars). Cooper Dam works in conjunction with Wright Patman Dam (National Inventory of Dams TX00021) to regulate flows along the Sulphur River, which feeds into the Red River. During large storm events, the dam temporarily stores flood waters to manage downstream flooding. After the storm passes and the Red River Basin recedes, water can be safety released downstream in accordance with the approved water control plan. Water storage and releases are managed by two water control gates operated by onsite USACE personnel. The project is primarily an earthen embankment dam and includes a 700-foot wide concrete spillway, which holds water to 18-feet below the top of the dam to regulate the reservoir when the pool elevation exceeds capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Cooper Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding are high volume releases from Cooper Dam through the un-gated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Cooper Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment in June 2019 and classified the risk associated with Cooper Dam as very low. This risk classification is primarily driven by the very low probability for dam failure and the small population at risk below Cooper Dam. The potential of breach for Cooper Dam was assessed to be related to three primary risks associated with earthen embankment dams: 1) During an extreme flood event, erosion may occur through the foundation near the old river channel leading to eventual breach of the dam, 2) Erosion along the interface of the outlet works conduit and main embankment during high reservoir elevations could lead to eventual breach of the dam, and 3) Instability of the concrete spillway during surcharge releases leads to slab displacement and uncontrolled erosion of the supporting embankment leading to breach of the dam. In the remote event of a dam breach the largest impacts would be to the city of Shreveport, Louisiana. Potentially impacted infrastructure includes road networks, electrical substations, communication facilities, police and fire stations, hospitals, airports, and schools. Wright Patman Lake and levee systems in the downstream populated areas would not experience overtopping and are likely to contain the floodwaters. Although the downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans; local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure; and local emergency managers meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, breach of the dam from either risk category could result in catastrophic flooding downstream and include widespread economic impacts and loss of life.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is continually taking proactive steps to reduce risk and ensure public safety. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning; annual updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions; and development of a detailed communications plan for the dam. USACE will continue to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as stockpiling materials to mitigate the potential for erosion of the embankment or foundation. Additionally, the dam is well maintained and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and increased surveillance during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions and there are pre-positioned materials at the project site to perform immediate flood fighting activities as necessary.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Starved Rock Lock and Dam was begun by the State of Illinois in 1926 but was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1933 for the purpose of navigation.  Starved Rock Lock and Dam is located on the Illinois River about 1 river mile east of the Village of North Utica, Illinois. The project consists of a lock chamber and a dam. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 19 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 1,280 feet and consists of a 30 feet long concrete wall fixed dam section, a headgate section 518 feet long with 30 original headgates permanently sealed with concrete in 1982, a non-Federal hydropower facility constructed in 1995 at headgate bays 22 through 28, a boiler house for producing steam for winter Tainter gate operations, an 52 feet long concrete ice chute ogee spillway, and the movable Tainter gate section 680 feet in length with 10 Tainter gates for regulating the upper pool. The non-Federal hydropower facility is 125 feet long has 4 turbines for producing electricity. The dam ties into the sandstone bluffs on the south side of the river at Starved Rock State Park. During flood events on the Illinois River, the Tainter gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Large floods cannot be passed entirely through the dam, causing the lock site and adjacent areas, including Dee Bennet Road, to go under water. Once water levels recede, the site is cleaned and normal operation of the project features resume. The biggest flood on record was on April 19, 2013 and submerged the lock chamber by 3 feet and 10 inches of water.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in June 2014 and classified the risk associated with Starved Rock Lock and Dam as moderate. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from the submergence of the Tainter gate counterweights during large floods, miter gate anchorage failure, Tainter gate failure due to barge impacts, and Tainter gate failure due to rock slope failure. The risk associated with the Tainter gate counterweight failure was reanalyzed in April 2021 to determine what would happen if all Tainter gates dropped to the closed position during a large flood. Due to the topography of the land in the vicinity of the lock and dam and the inflows during such an event, flooding impacts were almost identical whether the gates were open or closed. Based on these results, Starved Rock Lock and Dam was resubmitted for consideration to reclassify the risk of the project. The risk was reclassified as low in July 2021. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only.  There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Starved Rock Lock and Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "Fall Creek Dam is located on Fall Creek, a major tributary to the Middle Fork Willamette River, one mile upstream of Unity, Oregon and 25 miles upstream of Eugene and Springfield, Oregon. Fall Creek Dam is a 205 ft tall, 5,050 ft long rockfill earthen embankment dam with a concrete spillway, two spillway gates, and a regulating outlet. Fall Creek Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1964 and was completed in 1965. Fall Creek Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, conservation, water quality, and hydropower. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project (WVP). Fall Creek Dam is one of four WVP dams that does not include a powerhouse.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount of storage available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season.\n\nFall Creek Dam is located about 70 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. USACE completed a routine risk assessment for the Fall Creek Dam in October 2014 that characterizes the risk associated with the dam to be High.\n\nThe assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. The 2014 assessment concluded that the risk at Fall Creek Dam is driven by the high population downstream two possible, but very unlikely events: 1) an extreme earthquake occurring at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest or 2) an extreme flood event that fills the reservoir at a rate faster than the dam can pass water through the spillway. An extreme earthquake could cause the rockfill earthen dam to settle and crack, resulting in water overtopping and flowing through the dam. It is difficult to predict the exact amount of settlement and cracking that could occur to the dam as a result of such an earthquake. The speed and depth of water flowing over and through the damaged dam could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam and cause significant flooding downstream. The strong shaking from an earthquake could also damage the spillway\u2019s concrete structure and gates. The assessment also determined that fallen trees and woody debris floating in the reservoir could partially block the spillway gates during an extreme and unlikely rainfall event. The partial blockage of the spillway gates from the debris could reduce or prevent passage of flow through the dam, which would cause the reservoir to rise above and flow over the top of the embankment dam. As water flows over the top of the dam, the speed and depth of the water could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam. Because Fall Creek Dam is located upstream of Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, there is potential for devastating flooding to affect large downstream populations in urban areas and surrounding suburbs, as well as rural communities in the floodplain.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The likelihood is very low for an extreme earthquake or extreme flood resulting in a breach of the dam to occur, but the potential impacts of a dam failure are very high due to the large downstream population. Therefore, Fall Creek Dam will enter an advanced risk assessment called an Issues Evaluation Study (IES) starting in 2021 to further evaluate the dam\u2019s performance during extreme seismic and flood events. The study will also determine whether short-term targeted measures (called Interim Risk Reduction Measures) or long-term modifications are necessary to reduce the risk. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Fall Creek Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Fall Creek Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on advanced assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "Constructed in 1954 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mount Morris Dam and Recreation Area is a major flood control project and federal public park located on the Genesee River near the village of Mount Morris in Livingston County, New York. The primary purpose of the dam is to reduce flooding in downstream communities. The dam is situated deep in the Genesee River Gorge at the northern end of Letchworth State Park and provides flood protection to downstream areas including the village of Mount Morris and the city of Rochester. Mount Morris Dam is a concrete dam 248 feet tall and consists of a spillway in the center of two non-overflow sections totaling 1028 feet in length. Tens of thousands of people visit the Mount Morris Dam and Recreation Area each year, providing significant economic benefit to neighboring communities. The largest flood event experienced by the dam occurred in 1972 when the remains of hurricane Agnes passed through the area. During that event, water levels reached nearly to the spillway of the dam. Since construction, the Mount Morris Dam has successfully prevented over $3 Billion dollars' worth of flood damages in downstream communities. However, all dams carry an amount of risk.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The USACE finalized a risk assessment on the Mount Morris Dam in August 2016 that characterizes the risk of the project as low. There are three primary risks associated with the dam: : (1) a flood that is so large it exceeds the dam's capacity to store water, (2) a large flood which causes the concrete to fail internally and (3) water seepage into the dam's rock foundation leading to instability and failure. In the case of an exceptionally large flood, water would flow over the spillway for the first time in the dam's history. Although unlikely, these potential failures could lead to a rapid, uncontrolled release of water from the dam. This release of water would result in catastrophic flooding, significant loss of life and economic impacts. Localities at most risk and their expected maximum flood depths are:  Villages of Mount Morris (35 feet), Avon (18 feet), and Scottsville (10 feet); city of Rochester (14 feet); and towns of Geneseo (29 feet), Irondequoit (14 feet), and Brighton (15 feet). The village of Mount Morris is at particular risk due to the limited warning time between a failure at the dam and the arrival of flood waters. \n\nIn the event of a dam failure, under extremely high flow conditions, the New York State Canal Corporation-owned floodwall in Rochester will not prevent flooding in adjacent areas and bridges across the Genesee River will be flooded including the I-90, I-390, I-490 and I-590.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. Updated stability analyses are underway to determine if the seepage and concrete failure modes are possible and will determine if any remediation is required to reduce the risk to the public. The USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these inspections increases as the pool behind the dam rises. This routine monitoring ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Pine River as a timber dam in 1884 \u2013 1886; and reconstructed it as a more permanent concrete structure during April 1905 \u2013 June 1906.  Pine River Dam is one of six headwaters\u2019 dams on the Mississippi River.  The headwaters dams were constructed to supplement river flows for navigation purposes by filling the lakes in the spring and drafting them down as needed during the summer; but the headwaters dams have rarely been used for that purpose since the water control plans were revised in 1945.  The downstream lock & dam system constructed in the 1930\u2019s nearly eliminated the need for upstream water storage, so the dam is primarily operated to optimize recreation and environmental benefits. The dam has a concrete control structure and 16 reservoir rim dikes.  The dam is founded on timber bearing piles, although the new wingwalls added in 2001 have steel bearing piles.  There are 13 spillway bays each equipped with dual-leaf slide gates.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE considers Pine River to be a low-risk dam (DSAC-4) among its more than 700 dams.  The risk ranking is based on a screening-level assessment in 2009 that cited primary concerns as seepage at two dikes.  Although the dam was modified in 2001 for extreme floods (70% of the probable maximum flood), the water levels are held very stable by the storage capacity in the reservoir, the control structure discharge capacity, and winter drawdown planning for spring floods.  Breach modeling does show a hazard including direct loss of life for both the dam and some of the dikes, so the dam is listed as a high hazard dam.\nDams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Historic outflows from the dam have been less than 2500 cubic feet per second (CFS), but the dam has capacity to discharge up to 16,300 cfs.  Water released through the dam to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity could cause downstream flooding, although this would be extremely rare. The upstream reservoir has capacity to store water for flood risk management and the USACE operations use winter drawdowns to minimize high outflows from snowmelt in the spring.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. A dam safety assurance modification was completed at Pine River Dam and two of the reservoir rim dikes in 2001, and regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Morgantown Lock and Dam across the Monongahela River in 1950.  The dam is located about 27 miles downstream of the head of the Monongahela River at Fairmont, West Virginia and about 102 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Hildebrand Lock and Dam.  The dam is concrete and has six steel gates through which the river flows.  The lock provides a lift of about 17 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 84 feet wide by 600 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The pool created by the dam also provides water supply to municipal and industrial intakes and provides recreation opportunities. The economic benefits of shipping materials and goods through the lock, water supply, and recreation is nearly 1 million dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2009, which characterized the risk as low. The assessment identified one primary scenario that could cause the dam to fail.  When the river is at normal or elevated levels, water flowing through the dam gates could erode the rock at the dam\u2019s foundation, to the extent that portions of the dam could slide downstream and drain the upper pool.  If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequences would be the loss of shipping, water supply, and recreation, which would damage the regional economy by nearly 1 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping, water supply, and boat recreation.  This scenario is considered very unlikely because the dam has performed well for over 70 years without incident or indications that this scenario is occurring.  Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We regularly update our emergency action plan. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed the construction of Fishtrap Dam in 1969. The project was authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1938 (PL 75-761) and its purposes include flood risk management, recreation, fish and wildlife and low flow augmentation. Fishtrap Dam is a high-hazard potential dam three miles upstream of the confluence of the Russell and Levisa Forks of the Big Sandy River. The project is approximately 130 miles from the confluence of the Big Sandy River with the Ohio River. The project is in southern Pike County, Kentucky, approximately seven miles from Pikeville. \n\nThe Dam is 32 feet wide at the crest, with a length of 1,100 feet and a maximum base width of 990 feet. The structural height, or maximum height above the streambed, is 195 feet. The dam comprises a rock-fill embankment dam, an intake structure and tunnel, and a gate-controlled spillway. The 195-foot-tall embankment is composed of rock fill with an impervious core. The concrete gravity spillway structure is 258 feet wide and has four 57-foot by 37-foot gates.\n\nThe dam helps regulate waters coming from the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River and controls a drainage area of 395 square miles. It helps provide flood risk management all along the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River including Pikeville, Prestonsburg, Louisa, and Catlettsburg, Kentucky before the confluence of the Big Sandy River with the Ohio River.",
    "riskCharSummary": "A 2020 risk assessment for Fishtrap Dam classified it as having low risk of failure during a flood. Although risks associated with a breach or failure are low, the dam does not completely eliminate flood risks downstream.  Flooding can still occur even if Fishtrap Dam is operating as designed.  There are extremely rare (but possible) storms that could cause more rainfall than the dam can safely store.  During such an event, the gated spillway to the right (East) of the dam has the potential to pass up to 298 thousand cubic feet of water per second.  The operation of the spillway would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.  \n \nWhile the Fishtrap Dam spillway has never flowed, if operated it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities in Pikeville and Prestonsburg, impacting the Local Protection Projects (levees) in these communities. Similarly, significant impacts in the rural communities of Pike, Floyd, Johnson, and Lawrence Counties in Kentucky could be observed.  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along the Levisa Fork and local tributaries, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows.  \n \nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach hillside to hillside quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Fishtrap Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that US Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Fishtrap Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and US Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow US Amy Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with US Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built and completed New Hogan Dam in 1963. The dam structure is primarily a rockfill embankment which also includes a gated concrete spillway located near the southern end of the main dam. The dam is located on the Calaveras river approximately 28 miles northeast of Stockton in Calaveras County, CA.  The dam reduces the frequency of flooding in the city of Stockton, including other small communities, by holding back water during major flood events. In addition to reducing flooding downstream, the water held back by the dam forms New Hogan Lake. Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam is also authorized for municipal and industrial water supply, irrigation, hydropower generation, recreation, and environmental stewardship benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "New Hogan Dam has historically performed well and significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not fully eliminate the potential for downstream flooding.   USACE completed a risk assessment for New Hogan Dam in 2006 to understand how the dam might perform during certain scenarios and found the likelihood of the dam overtopping or failing in those cases to be moderate. USACE identified two primary areas of dam safety concern regarding New Hogan Dam. During an extreme flood event, the water level of New Hogan Lake is estimated to rise to 3 feet below the top of the dam due to the lack of spillway adequacy; therefore, water could spill over the dam if there is a presence of strong waves. In addition, an unlikely major earthquake could cause the soil in the dam and under the dam\u2019s foundation to temporarily move like a liquid, which can result in significant deformations and strength loss of the dam. The resulting deformations and strength loss can disrupt materials inside the dam and potentially the buried upstream control chamber. This in turn could initiate water seeping through the dam materials, causing voids from internal erosion and uncontrolled loss of water from the reservoir. Should the dam breach during an extreme flood event where New Hogan Lake is at maximum capacity, the downstream communities will see significant flooding which could result in loss of human life, economic impacts, and environmental damage. The population at risk includes portions of the city of Stockton as well as rural areas in San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties. Potentially impacted infrastructure includes road networks, electrical substations, communication facilities, police and fire stations, hospitals, airports, and schools. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, there is an emergency action plan for New Hogan Dam to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works closely with local emergency managers, regularly updates the emergency action plan, and conducts emergency exercises with state, federal, and local partners, all of which help reduce risk to the public. USACE has full-time staff members who work at New Hogan Dam. The staff performs regular maintenance and repairs as needed to keep the dam functioning properly and are available 24/7 to perform immediate inspections if an unusual event occurs.  USACE performs regular inspections and instrument monitoring to ensure that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. The frequency of these checks increases when New Hogan Lake rises. USACE incorporates weather forecasts to make informed decisions on how to operate the dam. The releases at New Hogan Dam are determined using the knowledge of local flows in the system and there may be situations where these localized flows change quickly and could affect the downstream communities. In most scenarios, the downstream communities would have a coordinated warning notification within minutes to hours depending on location before water reaches their homes. However, during very large and rare earthquake events, there may be little to no warning.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Dequeen Dam in June of 2017 that characterizes the risks associated with the project as low. Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "Flood control structures at the Tappan Lake Project includes an embankment with a parapet wall, an outlet works, and an uncontrolled saddle spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities; however, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Although Tappan Dam has historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event.  An event such as this could require unusually large quantities of water to be released. \n\nA 2024 risk assessment for Tappan Dam classified the risk of failure for the entire project system as low.  The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the uncontrolled spillway 800 feet south of the left abutment of the dam has the potential to pass up to 33, 250 cubic feet of water per second.   The uncontrolled spillway is designed to pass water to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.\n\nWhile the Tappan Dam spillway has never flowed.  If operated, it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Dennison, OH to Coshocton, OH.  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along Little Stillwater Creek, Stillwater Creek, and the Tuscarawas Creek, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows.  Although the odds of such a storm even occurring are considered extremely unlikely, Tappan Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any unanticipated scenarios were to occur.   \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach high elevations quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Tappan Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Tappan Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions, and flood fighting materials are stored onsite in case of an emergency.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Sam Rayburn Dam in 1966 with the project purpose to provide flood risk management, water supply, environmental regulation, recreation, and hydropower. Sam Rayburn Dam is located on the Angelina River about 10 miles northwest of the city of Jasper, Texas. Sam Rayburn Dam and Reservoir operates in conjunction with Town Bluff Dam (National Inventory of Dams TX00015) and B.A. Steinhagen Lake to provide flood control to the Angelina and Neches River Basin System. Since both projects went into operation, they have reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $2.3 Billion (adjusted to 2020 dollars). Sam Rayburn Dam is primarily an earthen embankment dam with a concrete outlet works and an uncontrolled labyrinth weir spillway, which holds water to 14-feet below the top of the dam to regulate the reservoir when pool elevation exceeds capacity. It also includes a hydropower facility which produces up to 52MWs of power supply for the Southwestern Power Administration. During large storm events, the dam temporarily stores flood waters to manage flooding downstream. After the storm passes and the Neches River Basin recedes, water can be safety released downstream in accordance with the approved water control plan. Water storage and flood releases are managed by the hydroelectric powerhouse and two water control gates operated by onsite USACE personnel.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Sam Rayburn Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding are high volume releases from Sam Rayburn Dam through the outlet works and uncontrolled spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Sam Rayburn Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment in November 2016 and classified the risk associated with Sam Rayburn Dam as moderate. This risk classification is primarily driven by the very low probability for dam failure and the number of large populations at risk below Sam Rayburn Dam. The potential for breach of Sam Rayburn Dam was assessed to be related to three primary risks associated with earthen embankment dams: 1) During an extreme flood event, erosion may occur at the left abutment leading to eventual breach of the dam, 2) Erosion may occur through the foundation near the old river channel leading to eventual breach of the dam, and 3) Erosion along the interface of the powerhouse facility and main embankment during high reservoir elevations could lead to eventual breach of the dam. In the remote event of a dam breach the largest impacts would be to the cities of Evadale, Beaumont, and Nederland, Texas. Potentially impacted infrastructure includes road networks, electrical substations, communication facilities, water treatment facilities, police and fire stations, hospitals, airports, and schools. Levees in the downstream populated areas would experience overtopping and would not contain the floodwaters. Although the downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans; local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure; and local emergency managers meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, breach of the dam from either risk category could result in catastrophic flooding downstream and include widespread economic impacts and significant loss of life.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is continually taking proactive steps to reduce risk and ensure public safety. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning; annual updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions; and development of a detailed communications plan for the dam. USACE will continue to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as stockpiling materials to mitigate the potential for erosion of the embankment or foundation. Additionally, the dam is well maintained and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and increased surveillance during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions and there are pre-positioned materials at the project site to perform immediate flood fighting activities as necessary.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam in 1937.  The lock and dam was built across the Savannah River on the Georgia/South Carolina border in the counties of Richmond (Georgia) and Aiken (South Carolina), and 12 miles downstream of the city of Augusta, Georgia.  The project was constructed for the purpose of improving commercial navigation between the Savannah Harbor and Augusta.  The dam consists of five vertical lift gates separated by concrete piers.  The three central gates are operated so that water flows beneath the bottom of the gates; the two end gates are typically operated so that water flows over the top of the gates.  The lock chamber exists on the Georgia side of the dam, with an operations building located where the dam joins the lock.  In the 1970s commercial navigation dwindled, with the last commercial shipment lockage occurring in 1979.  The project shifted to caretaker status, with funding allocated only for the minimum operational needs.  Lock operations continued to pass recreational craft and migratory fish.  Project maintenance efforts were very limited due to funding restraints so most issues that are typical of an aging structure went unrepaired.  In 2014, structural instability concerns with the lock walls caused all lockages to cease.  In 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvement for the Nation (WIIN) Act deauthorized the Lock & Dam project as a navigation structure.  Although the project no longer serves navigation, the pool formed by the dam is a source of water supply for several municipalities and various industry in the Augusta area.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam in October 2014 and classified the risk as low.  Although the structure is deteriorating from age and limited maintenance, the risk attributed to a dam failure is considered low due to a lack of affected downstream population and economic impacts.  A failure of the dam during normal river levels would cause minimal flooding that would stay within the banks of the Savannah River.  During elevated river flows, the difference in water levels from the upstream side of the dam (pool) to downstream side (tailwater) are less than one foot, thus there would be negligible impacts from a dam failure.  Consequentially, most economic impacts attributed to a dam failure are not from flood damages.  Economic impacts are associated with a loss of water supply to the municipalities and industries that use water from the Lock and Dam pool.\n\nAlthough the consequences are relatively minimal from a failure of the Lock and Dam, failure of the dam is considered a possibility.  The aging structure contains significant cracking, particularly in the concrete spillway piers.  Progressive erosion is occurring around the base of the lock wall posing a stability issue.  Although not likely, it is a possibility that failure of a spillway pier or the lock wall may occur, potentially as a result of a significant earthquake event.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking action to prepare for emergency incidents.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  USACE engineers perform annual inspections of the lock and dam and evaluate the dam\u2019s instrumentation on a quarterly basis.  These inspections and instrumentation evaluations are used to assess how the dam is performing.  Periodic training is conducted with project personnel responsible for the operation of the dam.  This training is to help project personnel, that regularly visit the dam, to identify the early warning signs of a potential issue with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Pine Creek Dam in 1969 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Pine Creek Dam is located on the Little River, about 5 miles northwest of Wright City, OK. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  After the storm passes and the Little River level recedes, the water can be safety released into the river.  Water storage and releases are managed by the gated outlet works running through the earthen embankment.  The project also includes an ungated spillway.  In addition to reducing flooding, the water held back by the dam forms a reservoir providing recreation benefits. Pine Creek Dam is also used for water supply and water quality purposes and fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in January 2018 and classified the risk associated with Pine Creek Dam as very low.  There is a remote potential for an extreme flood to occur that exceeds the capacity of the dam to store water resulting in water flowing over the top of the dam.  Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream resulting in loss of life and economic impacts.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the town of Wright City, OK.\nThere is also a potential for flooding during normal operation of the dam.  During large floods the capacity of the reservoir to store water could be exceeded resulting in flow over the spillway and downstream flooding.  While this flooding would be less than a breach scenario there is still a potential for economic impacts or loss of life due to the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The risk of dam failure was previously very high due to the potential for water to seep along the conduit leading to erosion of the embankment.  USACE lowered this risk with a dam modification  project where necessary repairs were made to the dam.  Repairs included construction of a wall to cutoff water seeping through the embankment and a steel lining within the conduit.  \n\nThere are also numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "Lake Mendocino is formed by water held behind Coyote Valley Dam.  Coyote Valley Dam is located on the East Fork of the Russian River, approximately 5 miles to the northeast of Ukiah, California.  Coyote Valley Dam was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1959 for flood control, water supply, recreation, and stream-flow regulation.  Coyote Valley Dam is an earth-fill dam with a 12-foot diameter pipe through the dam to allow for water releases.  The dam is owned and operated by USACE. The City of Ukiah uses water from Lake Mendocino for electric power generation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The USACE conducted a dam safety risk assessment of Coyote Valley Dam in 2022 and classified the dam as low risk.  The combination of life or economic consequences with the likelihood of failure of the dam is low and USACE considers this level of life-risk to be acceptable.  The main factor driving the risk of Coyote Valley Dam (in case of a very rare series of rain events) is overtopping of the main dam (beyond spillway) that can lead to erosion and breach of the main embankment.  The primary consequence center is Ukiah, California with a population at risk between 20,000 to 25,000.\n\nDams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking action to operate and maintain its dams in a safe and reliable manner in order to reduce risk to the public downstream. Risk reduction measures based on the risk assessment and USACE policy have been implemented.  These include emergency preparation, enhanced monitoring and surveillance of the dam under certain scenarios (such as higher than normal pool elevations).  \n\nCoyote Valley Dam is under constant monitoring by dam maintenance and operations staff, who are trained to identify dam safety concerns.  During flood events when reservoir levels and/or outflows from the dam are high, the staff is extra vigilant.  The dam's performance is monitored by instrumentation which are annually reviewed by the dam safety engineers.  \n\nThe dam's emergency action plan (EAP) provides guidance for communication and actions during developing dam safety situations. The EAP has been shared with local and state emergency managers for their awareness and action.  The EAP is intended to ensure quick response and provide proactive warnings in order to evacuate people out of harm's way downstream whenever it is needed.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nAlthough Franklin Falls Dam educes the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Franklin Falls Dam is designed to manage peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Franklin Falls Dam through the ungated spillway during high water events. This type of water release occurs when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Water moving through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a four-story building. While weather can be unpredictable, this type of event can often be predicted 1-2 days before flood waters would impact downstream communities. USACE will engage state emergency managers when such an event is forecasted and support actions to get people to safety.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment in 2024 and classified the risks associated with the Franklin Falls Dam as low. This classification is based on the large population that lives immediately downstream of the dam in Franklin, Concord, and Manchester, NH and Lowell, MA, as well as smaller communities along the Merrimack River. Three unlikely, but more devastating scenarios that would produce significant downstream flooding are breach of the dam due to water flowing over the top of the dam; spillway erosion leading to breach of the dam; or embankment erosion leading to breach. In the case of an extremely rare and large rain event, water could potentially flow over the top of the dam, which could cause erosion of the earthen embankment, and breach of the dam. In addition, large spillway flows could cause erosion in the channel downstream and potentially undermine the spillway control structure leading to a breach of the spillway structure. Last, internal erosion of the embankment could create a flow path through the dam, which would eventually allow the crest to collapse.  In these scenarios,  Franklin, Concord, and Manchester, NH and Lowell, MA, along with smaller communities along the river, would be the most impacted.  Downstream flooding in Franklin would occur less than an hour after of breach and the rapidly moving water could be as deep as 43 feet, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nFranklin Falls Dam is operated in conjunction with Blackwater Dam, and is staffed full time.  During high pools, Franklin Falls Dam is inspected on a daily basis.   When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The Jemez Canyon Dam project is owned and operated by the Albuquerque District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The project includes a dam located on the Jemez River, 2.8 miles upstream from its confluence with the Rio Grande, about five river miles upstream of Santa Ana Pueblo, and approximately 40 miles upstream of Albuquerque.  Construction was completed in 1953 and primary project features include a zoned earthen embankment dam; gated outlet works to adjust operational water releases into the Jemez River; and earth-cut spillway to pass much larger, uncontrolled releases during extreme events.  The project also includes Santa Ana Pueblo Protection Works, a smaller earthen embankment located upstream of the dam to reduce flood risk at the historic older Pueblo during periods of high lake levels.  The pool was released in 2001 and since then, river flows pass through open gates of the outlet works.  During flood events, the Jemez Canyon Dam project can be operated on its own or in conjunction with other dams to optimize upstream and downstream flood risk reduction in the Rio Grande Basin.  In addition to the project\u2019s main purpose of flood risk reduction, it is also authorized for sediment detention.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although the Jemez Canyon Dam project has successfully reduced flooding, it does not eliminate all flood risk caused by rain downstream of the dam or due to emergency operation of the project.  During infrequent emergency operation, larger required releases through the project\u2019s gated outlet works could surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled spillway flow have never occurred, flow through the spillway could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Jemez River and Rio Grande, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  Impacted communities include the Pueblo of Santa Ana, Pueblo of Sandia Village, low lying areas in Corrales and Albuquerque, Isleta Pueblo, Los Lunas, Socorro, and communities located in between.\n\nUSACE conducted a risk assessment of the Jemez Canyon Dam project in 2015.  Results characterize dam breach risk as LOW due to the combination of life loss consequences and low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the result of an extreme event.  Specifically, the occurrence spillway erosion leading to dam breach as the consequence of an infrequent storm event (0.001% chance per year) was identified.  The annual probability of dam breach due to spillway erosion is estimated to be moderate (1 in 10,000).  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation would be life-threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  Impacted communities include the Pueblo of Santa Ana, Pueblo of Sandia Village, low lying areas in Corrales and Albuquerque, Isleta Pueblo, Los Lunas, Socorro, and communities located in between.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquakes or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included addition of a rock fall arrest system to protect project infrastructure from damages and ensures access to critical project features; clearing debris from the outlet works to allow unobstructed flow through the conduit during both routine and high flow events; and grading to mitigate the occurrence of erosion on the downstream slope of the earthen embankment.  Planned activities include replacement of the gate hoist cables and erosion repairs on the downstream earthen embankment slope.  In addition, recent significant upgrades were made to the collection and pump system at the Santa Ana Protection Works.  Future risk communication activities include revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and development of a formal risk communication plan.  Flood warnings to notify affected communities downstream of the project are coordinated with external entities.",

    "projectDescription": "West Hill Dam was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1961 across the West River. This dam was built to hold water back during flood events to help reduce the risk of downstream flooding along the West and Blackstone Rivers. Dikes A, B, C and D, located west of the main dam, are also part of the project and were built to close off low points along the reservoir rim.  Dikes A, B and C would impact the same area as the main dam and are therefore included as part of this description. Dike D, on the other hand, impacts a slightly different area than West Hill Dam and has been included under a separate description. West Hill Dam does not normally hold significant water outside of flood events. The pool is normally kept at a depth of approximately 2 feet. Since it began operations up to 2021, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by approximately $119 million.\n\nThe dam is made of compacted earth fill and dumped rock fill with a concrete wall extending from the crest down to bedrock. The dam is approximately 5 stories (48 feet) high. The river flows through three concrete tunnels called conduits through the dam spillway. A dam\u2019s spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing. Metal gates in these tunnels are opened to allow water to pass and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events. To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the dam\u2019s spillway. The spillway at West Hill Dam is located to the right of the dam and is a sloped concrete structure. It is approximately half the length of a football field (50 feet) and is approximately 2 stories lower than the dam (18 feet).\n\nDikes A, B and C are composed of compacted earth fill and dumped rock fill and vary from 8 to 14 feet in height. The tops of the dikes are all at the same elevation as the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "A risk assessment of West Hill Dam was last completed in 2021 and has identified the risks associated with the dam and Dikes A, B and C, as Very Low. This classification is based primarily on the very low population living downstream of the dam that could potentially be impacted by flooding due to failure of the dam and dikes as well as the low likelihood of failure of the dam and dikes and catastrophic flooding occurring. The dam and dikes significantly reduce the risk of flooding to the surrounding communities. However, they do not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from West Hill Dam and Dikes A, B and C would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are three extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would result in failure of the dam and downstream flooding: (1) A flood so large that the capacity of the dam and dikes to store water is exceeded and at least one of them is compromised, (2) water seeping through the earth embankment and/or the bedrock foundation resulting in voids in the dam as the soil erodes, potentially weakening the dam, and (3) a seismic event weakens the dam and it\u2019s foundation coupled with the occurrence of a very large flood that further compromises the dam. Were either of these events to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. \n\nWoonsocket, RI, is the major area in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities both upstream and downstream of Woonsocket, including Uxbridge/Wheelockville, MA, and Pawtucket/Providence, RI would also be impacted, but less so. \n\nEven though extremely unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges. In a worst-case scenario, water could be almost as high as a two-story building (between 6 and 15 feet in some areas).",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists at West Hill Dam and under normal circumstances, there is very low risk to the public.  Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume normal operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we will take actions to reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of West Hill Dam and will modify operations, if necessary, to lower risk to the public. We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam and dikes. We will also continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Council Grove Dam in 1964 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities and water quality, as well as water supply, fish and wildlife, and recreation.  Council Grove Dam is located on the Neosho River at the town of Council Grove, Kansas.  Council Grove Dam consists of an earth fill embankment, a concrete gate tower outlet works, and an ungated spillway used to make releases during larger floods.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Council Grove Dam in 2022 and classified the risk associated with the dam as moderate. The risk is driven primarily by the potential for water to flow over the top of the dam during an extreme flood resulting erosion of the embankment and breach.  \n\nFailure of the dam would include flooding downstream resulting in loss of life and economic impacts. In the event of a dam breach, the primary impacted community would be Council Grove, KS located two river milers below the dam.  Other potential impact areas could include Dunlap, Americus, Emporia, Hartford, Neosho Rapids, and Hartford Kansas \n\nThere is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation of the dam which could include releases through the ungated spillway during a large flood.  While this flooding would be less than a breach scenario it could still result in economic impacts and potential loss of life depending on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts to help manage the risk that Council Grove Dam poses to downstream communities. These include conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "Foster Dam is located on the South Santiam River approximately 30 miles upstream of Albany, Oregon. Foster Dam is a 126ft tall, 2,985ft long rockfill earthen embankment dam with a 400ft long concrete spillway, four spillway gates, a concrete non-overflow section, and a powerhouse. Foster Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1964 and was completed in 1968. Foster Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, produce hydropower, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season. Foster Dam is downstream of Green Peter Dam.\n\nFoster Dam is 75 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. The assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. USACE is conducting advanced risk assessments, called Issue Evaluation Studies (IES), at several Willamette Valley Project dams including Foster Dam. \n\nAs of May 2021, results of the advanced study for Foster Dam identified the risk associated with the dam to be High. The risk is primarily driven by the high population downstream of the dam combined with two possible, but very unlikely events: 1) an extreme earthquake occurring at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest or 2) an extreme flood event. According to the study, the shaking from an extreme earthquake could cause the spillway gates and concrete supports on either side to become damaged. If this occurs when the reservoir is at its highest, the cracked and damaged spillway may no longer be able to hold back water, allowing a high volume of water to flow through the spillway and cause flooding of areas downstream. The study also determined that an extreme and very unlikely rainfall event could result in release of higher volumes of water through the dam than the gated spillway was designed to pass. The force and speed of the water flowing out of the dam could damage and erode the concrete lining in the spillway channel, exposing the underlying foundation rock that may be susceptible to erosion if subjected to very high flows. The continued force and speed of the water could erode the rock and destabilize the concrete structure itself. A sudden release of water could result from the destabilized concrete structure\u2019s lost ability to hold back the forces of the reservoir, causing significant downstream flooding. Another different scenario could occur if the extreme rainfall event instead fills the reservoir at a rate faster than the spillway is able to pass flow through the dam. Fallen trees and woody debris floating in the reservoir could partially block the spillway gates during the rainfall event, further limiting the amount of water that can pass through the spillway gates and allowing the reservoir to rise above the top of the embankment dam. As water flows over the top of the dam, the speed and depth of the water could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam. As the soil and rock continue to erode, more water is released over and through the dam at greater speeds and depths, causing significant flooding downstream. Because Foster Dam is located upstream of Sweet Home and Lebanon, there is potential for flooding to affect large downstream populations in the floodplain areas.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The likelihood is low for an extreme earthquake or an extreme rainfall event to occur, but the potential impacts of a dam failure are high due to the large downstream population. USACE continues to evaluate the performance of the spillway during earthquake and flood loads using advanced computer modeling of the dam\u2019s concrete and gated structures to better understand if and how much the spillway could become damaged. This will help inform whether the potential damages from extreme earthquake or flood loads continue to drive risk at the project, and whether short-term targeted measures (called Interim Risk Reduction Measures) or long-term modifications will be necessary to reduce risk. USACE also continues to study the likelihood of an extreme rainstorm that would be large enough to cause damaging spillway flows. USACE continues to regularly conduct routine inspections of its dams and Foster Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Foster Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Melvern Dam, completing in May 1973. Melvern Dam is located on the Marais Des Cygnes River, approximately 4 miles upstream of Melvern, KS. Downstream of the dam is agricultural land and the communities of Melvern, KS and Ottawa, KS. The dam was authorized for flood control, water supply, recreation, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Melvern Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $257 Million (2019 price level) from 1973 to 2019. The dam is 9,750 feet long composed of rolled earthfill. The top of the dam sits approximately 123 feet above the stream bed.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed the Melvern Lake flood storage capacity would cause the release of water through the uncontrolled spillway to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam. This can result in flooding at downstream areas.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment for Melvern Dam in May 2020 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the risk due to a dam breach is characterized as low. If an extreme flood event occurs, inflows into the reservoir may exceed the storage and release capacity of the dam, and overtopping may occur. Other potential failure modes may lead to a breach of the dam prior to overtopping.  If a dam breach occurs this would cause a sudden release of water downstream. This would result in extreme flooding in the agricultural land downstream and the communities of Melvern, KS and Ottawa, KS.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Wappapello Dam in 1941, and continues to own, operate, and maintain the facility today. Located across the St. Francis River, the dam helps control flooding to the downstream counties of Wayne, Stoddard, Dunklin, Butler, and New Madrid, MO. The project was originally constructed to provide flood control and has since been modified to include recreation, and conservation of fish and wildlife. The dam is located 16 miles northeast of Poplar Bluff, Missouri and less than one mile southwest of Wappapello, Missouri. The complete structure consists of an earth fill dam, gated outlet works, an auxiliary spillway, and three small saddle dikes in the rim near the left abutment.\nReservoir water is released into the St. Francis River through a concrete outlet works controlled by 3 slide gates. The dam\u2019s auxiliary spillway is located on its south side and is designed to pass high volumes of flood waters to prevent the dam from being overtopped and breaking. On rare occasions when the spillway is activated, the water passes over a concrete rim and slope into the spillway outlet channel and eventually back into the St. Francis River.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Wappapello Dam greatly reduces flood risks downstream, it does not eliminate these risks. Flooding can still occur even if Wappapello Dam operates as designed. Unlikely but possible storm scenarios exist that could cause more rainfall than Wappapello Dam can safely store. To pass such a large amount of water, the outlet works gates may need to be fully opened and the dam\u2019s auxiliary spillway may activate to pass extreme flow events to keep Wappapello Dam from overtopping and breaking. \n\nWappapello Dam completed a Semi-Quantitative Risk Assessment (SQRA) in 2020 and an Issue Evaluation Study (IES) in 2021, confirming that the risks of failure associated with Wappapello Dam are considered moderate, which is in the middle of the five risk categories. The risk of Wappapello Dam is driven by performance related to seepage in the sand foundation under the dam during a flood event. Wappapello Dam is currently under-going a Dam Safety Modification Study (DSMS) to address these concerns. The DSMS is was completed in 2024 and is in the queue awaiting funding for construction.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE also regularly inspects the dam and routinely reassesses its risks. Interim risk reduction measures have also been implemented at Wappapello Dam that will minimize the exposure to risk while necessary long term remediation efforts are pursued. Wappapello Dam has recently gone through a Dam Safety Modification Study (DSMS). This study looked at a permanent, robust, and resilient design that will greatly reduce risks over the entirety of the project.\n\nDuring high-water events, USACE dam safety professionals increase surveillance of the dam as lake levels rise and are prepared to act if an issue occurs. USACE personnel also monitor river conditions to help optimize the dam\u2019s operations.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Town Bluff Dam in 1951 with the project purpose of re-regulating water releases from Sam Rayburn Dam (upstream), water supply, environmental regulation, recreation, and hydropower. Town Bluff Dam is located on the Neches River about 10 miles southwest of the city of Jasper, Texas. Town Bluff Dam operates in conjunction with Sam Rayburn Dam (National Inventory of Dams TX00011) to provide flood control along the Angelina and Neches River Basin Systems. Since both projects went into operation, they have reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $2.3 Billion (adjusted to 2020 dollars). The project is comprised primarily of a concrete lined earthen embankment (which also serves as an uncontrolled overflow spillway), a gated outlet works with six tainter gates, and a hydropower plant which produces up to 6MWs of power supply for the Southwestern Power Administration. During large storm events, the project operates as a run-of-the-river dam, increasing outflow to match inflow until reaching the top of spillway. When the reservoir elevation exceeds the top of spillway, project releases become uncontrolled until inflows reduce to levels manageable with the gated outlet works. Water control and flood releases are managed in accordance with the approved water control plan by the six tainter gates operated by onsite USACE personnel.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Town Bluff Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding are high volume releases from Sam Rayburn Dam along the Angelina River and/or high-volume inflows along the Neches River resulting in high flows from Town Bluff Dam. High flow, surcharge releases occur when the reservoir's inflow capacity exceeds the downstream channel capacity of 20,000 cfs. Town Bluff Dam is designed as a run-of-the-river dam, increasing outflow initially through the gates and then over the uncontrolled spillway to match inflow without risking the structural integrity of the dam. USACE completed a risk assessment in January 2022 and classified the risk associated with Town Bluff Dam as low. This risk classification is primarily driven by the very low probability for dam failure and the number of large populations at risk below Town Bluff Dam. The risk for breach of Town Bluff Dam was assessed to be related to the potential for erosion of the foundation near the gated spillway structure during periods of higher-than-normal pool levels when required releases are not being made. In the remote event of a dam breach or high-volume surcharge releases the largest impacts would be to the cities of Evadale, Beaumont, and Rose City, Texas. Potentially impacted infrastructure includes road networks, electrical substations, communication facilities, water treatment facilities, police and fire stations, hospitals, airports, and schools. Levees in the downstream populated areas would not experience overtopping and are expected to contain the floodwaters. Although the downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans; local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure; and local emergency managers meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, breach of the dam or surcharge releases over the uncontrolled spillway could result in catastrophic flooding downstream and include widespread economic impacts and loss of life.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continually taking proactive steps to reduce risk and ensure public safety. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning; annual updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions; and development of a detailed communications plan for the dam. We will continue to identify and implement risk reduction measures such as stockpiling materials to mitigate the potential for erosion of the embankment or foundation. Additionally, the dam is well maintained and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and increased surveillance during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions and there are prepositioned materials located at the project site to perform immediate flood fighting activities as necessary.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Perry Dam, completing in 1966. Perry Dam is located on the Delaware River, in the south-central part of Jefferson County, KS. Downstream of the dam are the communities of Perry, Lawrence, and Kansas City in Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri. The dam was authorized for flood control, water supply, recreation, fish & wildlife enhancement, and releases to support flows in the Kansas River for navigation. Perry Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $10.1 billion (2016 price level) from 1967 to 2016. The dam is 7,750 feet long composed of rolled earthfill. The top of the dam sits approximately 121 feet above the stream bed.  Additionally, the Perry Lake project contains a 1,550 feet long saddle dike between the left abutment and spillway to complete the reservoir rim.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Perry Dam in July 2017 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the risk due to dam breach is characterized as low. USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed the Perry Lake storage capacity can require the release of water through the outlet works or the uncontrolled spillway, even if the rivers and creeks are at or beyond capacity to prevent overtopping and failure of dam. This can result in flooding at downstream areas or can worsen already existing flooding downstream due to creeks and rivers being over capacity.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the J. Strom Thurmond Dam and Lake in 1952.  The dam, formerly known as Clarks Hill Dam, was built across the Savannah River on the Georgia/South Carolina border in the counties of Columbia (Georgia) and McCormick (South Carolina), and 22 miles upstream of the city of Augusta, Georgia.  There were several purposes for the construction:  flood risk reduction, navigation of the river below Augusta, and for the production of hydropower.  The dam is operated as a system in conjunction with two other USACE dams located immediately upstream of Thurmond Dam:  Richard B. Russell and Hartwell.  The system of dams aids in the reduction of downstream flooding by holding back water during major storm events.  The Thurmond Dam structure consists of a large concrete dam section with earthen embankments on either side.  A gated spillway exists within the concrete section.  The spillway contains 23 large, rotating gates called Tainter gates that can pass large volumes of water through the dam.  As the gates are raised, the dam can store more water within the reservoir which further minimizes downstream flooding.  Since construction of the dam, the spillway gates have only been opened six times due to flooding.  Altogether, Thurmond, Russell, and Hartwell dams have prevented approximately $370 million in flood damages since construction.  The Augusta Levee located along the Georgia-side of the Savannah River is a separate but critical feature designed to prevent damages from flooding in the Augusta area.  There are other populated areas located outside of the leveed area that would be directly impacted by out-of-bank flows, namely immediately downstream of the dam on the South Carolina side of the river.  The Thurmond Dam hydropower plant produces an average annual output of 700 million kilowatt-hours of electrical energy.  In addition to flood risk reduction, hydropower, and navigation, Thurmond Dam and Lake also provides benefits via the following:  water supply, recreation, water quality, and fish and wildlife management.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for J. Strom Thurmond Dam in May 2015.  The assessment characterizes the risk of the project as low.  The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  There is a large population that resides downstream of the dam, particularly within the city of Augusta, Georgia.  During large storm events, Thurmond Dam's spillway gates will be opened to keep the reservoir level below the top of the spillway gates.  As the gates rise open, the flow in the river downstream is increased and more water is allowed to be held in the reservoir.  During an extreme storm event, an exceedingly large flow may need to be passed through Thurmond's spillway to prevent the lake from reaching the top of the dam.  These rare events will result in river flows that could overtop the Augusta Levee and impact widespread areas downstream of the dam with dangerous flood waters.  It should be noted that Thurmond's spillway gates have only been opened six times due to flooding, and the amount of flow passed through the dam has been minimal.  Thurmond Dam is well maintained and has historically performed well with no issues of immediate concern.  However, there is a slight chance that high lake levels or significant earthquake events may result in a breach of one of the embankments resulting in deep and swift downstream flooding.  This is an unlikely event, but one that should be considered as a possibility.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking action to prepare for emergency incidents.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  USACE engineers and project personnel perform regular inspections of the dam and evaluate the dam's instrumentation.  These inspections and instrumentation evaluations are used to assess how the dam is performing.  The frequency of the inspections and instrumentation checks increases as the Thurmond Lake level rises in order to detect and identify any potential dam safety issues.  Periodic training is conducted with Thurmond Dam project personnel.  This training is to help project personnel, that are at the site on a daily basis, to identify the early warning signs of a potential issue with the dam.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.   Additionally, USACE works closely with Augusta-Richmond County during flood events.  The USACE operations plan for Thurmond Dam requires a stepped spillway release during major flood events and prospective/impending dam failure events.  This allows time for Augusta-Richmond County to close gate structures within the levee and to set levee stoplog closures before the full, required spillway releases are commenced.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Indian Rock Dam in 1942 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on the Main Branch of Codorus Creek in York County, PA, at the confluence with the South Branch Codorus Creek.  The dam is approximately two miles upstream of York, Pennsylvania, and fifteen miles upstream of the confluence with the Susquehanna River.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment which creates a lake only during storm events.  Flow discharges through a conduit in the abutment of the dam and gates control the releases when there is a lake.  The project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Indian Rock Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to Codorus Creek.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  York, Grantley and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Codorus Creek would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Indian Rock Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Thomaston Dam in 1960 across the Naugatuck River. The dam holds back water during flood events and works together with nearby Northfield Brook and Black Rock Dams to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Naugatuck River. Thomaston Dam does not normally hold water outside of flood events. The dam was built in response to the severe flooding that occurred in the region in 1955. Since it began operations, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $840 million.\n\nThe dam is made of compacted earth and rock fill and is approximately 14 stories (140 feet) high. A 10-foot diameter concrete pipe called a conduit passes through the dam.  Metal gates at the upstream side of the conduit are opened to allow water to pass through the dam and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events. To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the spillway, a sloped concrete structure located at the southeast end of the dam. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing. The spillway is longer than a football field and approximately two stories below the top of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists at Thomaston Dam. Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we are taking actions to further reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of Thomaston Dam and will modify operations if we feel there is risk to the public. We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner. USACE is undertaking additional study to further understand the risk associated with Thomaston Dam, and what, if any, actions can be completed to reduce the risk.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Falls Lake Dam in 1981 across the Neuse River and continues the ownership, maintenance, and operation of the facility. The dam reduces the flood risks for Raleigh, North Carolina and downstream communities. It also provides water supply, water quality, fish and wildlife enhancement, and outdoor recreation for several surrounding communities. The 95-foot-tall dam is located immediately upstream of Raleigh. It is comprised of compacted earth built between two hillsides and is approximately 1,915 feet (over a third of a mile) long.  \nFalls lake is operated for flood reduction on the Neuse River to maintain maximum benefits downstream and to meet all authorized purposes of the impounded reservoir. All release decisions are made using a Water Control Manual created specifically for conditions in the Neuse River Basin. During periods when flood waters are being accumulated in the lake, water releases from the dam are made considering available flood storage behind the dam, predicted inflow into the lake, conditions downstream, and (to a lesser degree) impacts to the other authorized purposes.\nWater is released through one outlet tunnel. The tunnel is large enough to fit a tractor trailer into and is capable of releasing 12,000 cubic feet per second (or about 90,000 gallons per second), but releases would typically not exceed about 7,500 cubic feet per second (or about 56,000 gallons per second) during non-emergency flood operations. The dam\u2019s auxiliary spillway is an engineered notch in the hillside located on the left (north) side of the dam. This notch is lower than the top of the dam and is designed to pass high volumes of flood waters. The spillway is necessary to keep the dam from being overtopped and breaching (breaking) during these high-volume flood events. In the unlikely event that the lake rises above the top of the auxiliary spillway, the auxiliary spillway passes this water to the Neuse River instead of over the dam. Flow over the auxiliary spillway would depend on how high the water level reaches, ranging from only minor flow if the water was just over the auxiliary spillway, to as much as 70,000 cubic feet per second (or about 524,000 gallons per second) if the dam was close to being overtopped. Water levels have never reached the highest point of the auxiliary spillway, therefore, it has yet to pass any flood waters.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Falls Lake Dam greatly reduces flood risks downstream, it does not eliminate these risks. Flooding can still occur even if Falls Lake Dam is operating as designed/intended. There are also very rare but possible storm evets which cause more rainfall than Falls Lake Dam was designed to store safety. To pass that large amount of water, the outlet of the dam may need to be fully utilized. There are very rare events that would exceed the capacity of Falls Lake Dam to safety store these waters. Therefore, when storm waters reach the height of the dam\u2019s auxiliary spillway, this feature passes this water to keep the dam from overtopping and breaching (breaking). If the auxiliary spillway does flow and the lake level is near the top of the dam, an excess of 20 or more feet of water may flood the river valley in the vicinity downstream of the dam, potentially inundating areas far beyond the riverbanks. This water is likely to damage and destroy houses, buildings, roads, bridges, power, and water supply. While weather can be unpredictable, this type of event can often be predicted 1-2 days before flood waters would impact communities. USACE would be in full communication with local and state emergency managers to alert and evacuate the public. In the unlikely event Falls Lake Dam must pass these extreme waters, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.\nIn 2012, Falls Lake Dam was assessed for any concerns that might cause the dam to fail during rare events. USACE has classified these risks of failure associated with Falls Lake Dam as Moderate. The dam is well built and has performed well during the past 40 years. Ground water moving through the right (south) side of the dam where it abuts the hillside has been observed and may encourage erosion, but no signs of erosion have been observed to date. Modern forecast also suggests that extreme and rare weather could challenge the capacity of the dam to safely pass these storms. Current models indicate the dam is designed with sufficient height for these rare events, but as with all weather forecasts, there is always uncertainty on the impact extreme weather can have. While unlikely, if these concerns were to cause the dam to fail, thousands of people would be in harm\u2019s way. Therefore, it is important to heed all directives to evacuate as communicated by local emergency managers. \nIt is also important to note, when Falls Lake Dam impounds storm waters to reduce flood risks downstream, partial inundation of USACE facilities may lead to closures of recreation sites. Boating may become hazardous due to floating debris. Therefore, it is important to heed all directives to evacuate these facilities.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure Falls Lake Dam continues to operate to minimize flood risks while balancing all its project functions, USACE utilizes the latest forecast, and stream gauge information. USACE coordinates closely with the National Weather Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and various stakeholders, concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. USACE continues to work with these officials to help prepare and practice for emergency response efforts. Close coordination with local and state emergency management officials allows them to act in a timely manner during an event.\nThe dam is also regularly inspected, and its risks routinely re-assessed. During high water events dam safety professionals continuously monitor the dam and are prepared to act if performance issues arise during an event. Because risk has been determined to be moderate, an advanced risk assessment (Issue Evaluation Study) has begun and is scheduled to be completed in 2022. \nIn the meantime, USACE has begun implementing a series of actions to reduce flood risks. The Emergency Action Plan has been updated to prepare for the highest risks to the project, emergency materials have been stockpiled on site which would help slow or stop erosion if it were observed, and additional instrumentation has been installed to help with monitoring the condition of the dam. In the future, additional measures are planned to include increased communication with downstream populations.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be very low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates have been developed for this dam since there is potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated.  This dam is authorized, designed, and operated for water supply and flood damage reduction and stores water for those purposes.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, flooding nearby could occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to store water to reduce downstream flooding that would occur naturally.   But during a very large flood, flooding could occur downstream, and failure would result in additional flooding downstream.  Flood mapping has been developed to indicate potential flooding extents during a range of river conditions. These maps should be used by the public and state and local emergency managers for their awareness and preparedness in the event of a dam breach incident.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nThe 2015 Periodic Assessment found the incremental risks to be mostly driven by the potential for concentrated leak erosion along the conduit where compaction of embankment material would have been difficult during construction, and by the potential for wave induced erosion of the upstream slope, exacerbated by the deteriorated condition of the upstream riprap. These failure modes are considered to be low risk.  The performance of the dam has been good to date.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nInundation mapping for the current inflow design flood has been updated for East Brimfield Dam.  The project is staffed full-time by employees trained in dam safety.  Instruments are monitored monthly.  No Interim Risk Mitigation Measures are needed for this dam because it is considered to be low risk.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Russell B. Long Lock and Dam was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1995 for the purpose of navigation.  Russell B. Long Lock and Dam is located on the Red River in Red River Parish, approximately 7 miles southeast of Coushatta, Louisiana. This is the fourth lock and dam complex of the five locks and dams that comprise the Mississippi River to Shreveport, Louisiana, reach of the J. Bennett Johnston Waterway project. The major project features for Russell B. Long include the lock chamber (including gate bays), guide walls and guard walls, Tainter gated dam, hinged crest spillway, cutoff wall, the earthen closure dam, approach channel slopes, and access roads. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. During flood events on the Red River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam. Annual navigation benefits were estimated to be $30 million in 2018 dollars.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2019 and classified the risk associated with Russell B. Long Lock and Dam as low. The primary risk driver involves failure of the closure dam due to overtopping. The second risk driver involves seepage and piping through the closure dam embankment foundation interface which leads to failure of the closure dam. These risk drivers could lead to closure of lock for navigation or loss of upstream pool due to dam failure, which also leads to loss of navigation. The weighted average incremental economic loss is between $10 million and $100 million per failure.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Russell B. Long Lock and Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nAlthough Ball Mountain Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Ball Mountain Dam is designed to manage peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Ball Mountain Dam through the ungated spillway during high water events. This type of water release occurs when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Water moving through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk all along the Connecticut River down to Middleton, Connecticut. While weather can be unpredictable, this type of event can often be predicted 1-2 days before flood waters would impact downstream communities. USACE will engage state emergency managers when such an event is forecasted and support actions to get people to safety.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment in 2017 and classified the risks associated with the Ball Mountain Dam as low. Communities would be impacted all along the Connecticut River from Vermont to the Long Island Sound.  The unlikely, but devastating scenario that would produce significant downstream flooding is erosion in the river channel soils leading to breach of the dam.  This erosion could start and then continue though the the foundation soil, which could erode the placed embankment.   Downstream flooding in Brattleboro would occur within an hour of breach and the rapidly moving water could be as deep as 61 feet, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances.",

Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nBall Mountain Dam is operated in conjunction with Townshend Dam.  Staff is shared between the two facilities, which are staffed full time.  During high pools, Ball Mountain Dam is inspected on a daily basis.  When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  At very high levels, project staff stays on site for 24 hour watches. Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The Buford Dam was authorized by Congress in the 1950 Flood Control Act to generate hydropower and reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Buford Dam is located on the Chattahoochee River approximately 45 miles Northeast of Atlanta.  It was designed and constructed in 1956 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and resulted in the formation of Lake Lanier, a 59 square mile reservoir, that supplies water to Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. The dam also provides navigation, has a thriving fish and wildlife ecosystem, and is the most-visited Corps of Engineers lake site in the nation.\n\nThe Buford Dam is constructed of compacted soil.  Smaller dams, or saddle dikes, are located in three areas around the lake to help contain the lake.   Water is released into the river beneath the dam through the hydropower units or through a small tunnel in the powerhouse called a sluice.  An overflow spillway is cut into the shoreline to pass water during major flood events. However, to date there has not been a flood event that has required the use of this spillway.\n\nThe earthen dam is over 1,500 feet long, almost 200 feet high, and 40 feet wide at the top of the dam. The overflow spillway is located to the left of the embankment and is 100 feet wide with a crest elevation of 1,085 feet. \n\nFlooding downstream has been greatly reduced since the dam was built.  On average the dam has reduced the damage caused by flooding by about $20 million each year, generated nearly $24 million in hydropower each year, and almost $70 million in annual recreation benefits to the region.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment on July 30, 2020 and has classified the risks associated with the Buford Dam as Moderate.  The dam was found to be well-designed, well-constructed, and well-maintained and is expected to be reliable during major floods.  The dam is located in the Atlanta metropolitan area and people in this area could see life threatening flooding during large floods which require use of the overflow spillway, which is a situation that has never happened before.  Additionally, there are also two very unlikely flood scenarios where (1) the area experiences a flood so large that it overwhelms the dam causing the dam to fail as water spills over the top of it, or (2) water seeping through a saddle dike erodes its embankment to the point of failure.  If either of these scenarios were to occur flood waters would be extremely swift and deep and cause catastrophic flooding downstream, widespread economic impacts, and significant loss of life.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be in communities downstream of the dam, especially in the areas of Sugar Hill, Duluth, and Peachtree Corners.  Key infrastructure along the river would be damaged or destroyed and historic flooding on the river could occur all the way to the Gulf of America, impacting the states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously working to manage the risk to the public.  This includes working with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.   USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam.  The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.\n\nFollow the Mobile District on Facebook at www.facebook.com/USACEMOBILE/\nLake Lanier on Facebook  https://facebook.com/LakeSidneyLanierUSACE/\n\nConsider purchasing flood insurance to protect your property\nVisit: www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program\n\nCreate a family emergency plan and determine your evacuation route with the goal of getting to higher ground. \nVisit: www.ready.gov\n\nConnect with your local representatives and officials to sign up for personalized alerts.\nGeorgia EMA Alerts and Warnings\thttps://gema.georgia.gov/plan-prepare/alerts-and-warnings\nForsyth County Emergency Management Agency     https://www.forsythco.com/Departments-Offices/Emergency-Management-Agency\nGwinnett County Emergency Management Agency   https://www.gwinnettcounty.com/web/gwinnett/departments/police/emergencymanagement",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Milford Dam, completing in 1966. Milford Dam is located on the Republican River, approximately 4 miles Northwest of Junction City, KS. Downstream of the dam is agricultural land and the major communities of Junction City, Manhattan, Topeka, Lawrence, Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri. The dam was authorized for flood control, water supply, water quality, navigation, recreation, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Milford Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $1.3 billion (2010 price level) from 1967 to 2010. The dam is 6,300 feet long composed of rolled earthfill. The top of the dam sits approximately 147 feet above the stream bed.  Normal releases of water pass through the outlet works near the south end of the dam. The Milford Dam project also contains a 1,250 feet wide uncontrolled spillway south of the embankment.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed the Milford Lake storage capacity can cause the release of water through the uncontrolled spillway to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam. This can result in flooding at downstream areas.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment for Milford Dam in July 2016 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low. As with all earthen embankment dams, if an extreme flood event occurs, inflows into the lake may exceed the storage and release capacity of the dam, and overtopping may occur. If overtopping occurs the earthen embankment could erode leading to a sudden release of water downstream. This would result in extreme flooding in the downstream communities with the worst impacts at the communities of Junction City, KS and Manhattan, KS.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed the East Lynn Dam in 1971. The project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1962 (PL 87-874) primarily for flood control. East Lynn Dam is a high hazard dam located in Wayne County, West Virginia. Most dams that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages, if breached, would lead to loss of life and/or high economic impacts downstream causing them to be labeled \u201chigh hazard\u201d.\u202fThe dam is located 1.6 miles south of the town of East Lynn and 42 miles above the mouth of Twelvepole Creek. When the dam is not storing flood waters to reduce flood risks downstream, the dam operates to impound water for flood control, water conservation for general recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement. This lake is raised in the warmer months to support boat access and lowered in the winter months for additional flood storage.\u202f \n\nThe dam helps regulate waters on Twelvepole Creek in the 133 square mile drainage area upstream of the dam. The dam helps to provide flood risk management downstream along the Twelvepole Creek, to Wayne, West Virginia, with additional benefits to Lavalette, West Virginia and other points downstream to the Ohio River. East Lynn Dam provides waters to keep downstream rivers flowing. However, when it is projected that Twelvepole Creek may cause flooding, water coming from upstream of the dam is stored until streams and rivers downstream of the dam recede. Typically storm waters can be released in a controlled manner to reduce flood impacts downstream. However, there are rare storms which can cause more rainfall and runoff than East Lynn Dam can store safely. When this occurs, the dam\u2019s spillway will begin to release or spill these waters to reduce the chance that the dam could be overtopped.\u202f\u202f \n\nThe embankment is a rolled rock fill construction with an impervious core, reaching a maximum height of 113 feet. The outlet works is comprised of an approach channel, intake structure, tunnel transition, tunnel, stilling basin, outlet channel, and service bridge. Flow is controlled through three sluice gates and a low-flow system. An emergency closure system is also in place for any open sluice. Additionally, a 230-foot-wide broad-crested uncontrolled spillway is located through the left valley wall that discharges into a natural ravine and returned to Twelvepole Creek about half a mile downstream from the dam. Records of average annual flood damages prevented for the dam were available from 1971 to 2018, with a cumulative total of $284.2 million (2024 price level). The average annual lost benefit of $5.9 million was obtained by dividing the cumulative total by the 48 years the project has been in operation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for East Lynn Dam in 2021 and classified the risk associated with failure as very low. Three risk drivers were identified during this assessment. (1) Overtopping of the embankment, (2) spillway erosion, and (3) concentrated leak erosion through the left abutment and embankment. Overtopping the embankment was the leading risk driving potential failure mode (PMF) for this assessment but ultimately is still considered to be a relatively low-risk event with a probability of 1 in a million.    \n\nEast Lynn Dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities and although the risks associated with a breach or failure are very low, the dam does not eliminate flood risks downstream. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding can still occur in a very large rainfall event. This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillway. \n\nThe primary consequence center is Wayne, WV, located 13 river miles downstream of East Lynn Dam. There are no dams downstream of East Lynn Dam but there is a levee system located at the confluence of Twelvepole Creek and the Ohio River. The Ceredo-Kenova levee, located 42 river miles downstream of the dam, would not be overtopped by the total peak outflow from the dam for the probable maximum flood (PMF) event. This means that the levee would be able to protect the surrounding area from flooding in the event of a PMF.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "Cold Brook Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Completed in 1953, the project is one of two built by USACE in the Fall River basin to reduce risks from flooding in Hot Springs, S.D. (The second project is Cottonwood Springs.) When not operating the project to reduce flood impacts, water releases support recreation and fish and wildlife. Cold Brook Dam also provides water to Larive Lake.\n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet structure to release stored water, and a spillway. During normal operations, the outlet structure releases water to downstream users and flows are generally less than 10 cubic feet per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons). As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff and managing reservoir elevations, USACE can release up to 1,500 cfs from the outlet structure. When reservoir levels from extreme storms or snowmelt exceed the outlet structure\u2019s release capacity, water can flow through the spillway to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to the dam\u2019s failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to release up to 80,600 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release. The reservoir has never been high enough for spillway flow.\n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Cold Brook Dam as a result of flooding was approximately 19 cfs from the outlet structure in 1999. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Cold Brook Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can Cottonwood Springs Dam). While unlikely, non-breach releases when the reservoir is full are critical to reducing the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures would be devastating, but overtopping could erode the embankment, leading to a breach, and allowing water stored behind the dam to flow uncontrolled downstream and further intensify downstream flooding.\n\nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threat that could lead to a dam breach during an extreme flood is overtopping of the embankment. Although this scenario is very unlikely, overtopping would cause catastrophic flooding with swift, deep, and life-threatening floodwaters in many parts of Hot Springs and communities along Fall River. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial facilities).   \n\nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Cold Brook Dam as \u201cmoderate\u201d among its more than 700 dams due to the downstream consequences in Hot Springs, SD. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences, in the unlikely event of large releases of water or dam failure. For more information on the USACE Dam Safety Program and risk assessments, visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Ongoing Actions: Although dams do not eliminate flood risk, the USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks. For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.\n\nActions at Cold Brook Dam: While USACE continues to evaluate how to further reduce the risks associated with the dam, several interim measures are complete, including maintenance of instruments that monitor the structure\u2019s performance and vegetation management to ensure the outlet channel\u2019s flow capacity.\n\nBuilding Risk Awareness: Hot Springs and other downstream communities are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Saylorville Dam in June 1975 for the purpose of flood risk management, water quality, water supply, recreation, and fish and wildlife.  Saylorville Dam is located on the Des Moines River about 9 miles north of the City of Des Moines, Iowa. The earthen dam is over a mile long with a maximum height of 125 feet. Water can be released from the lake in two ways. The first is through the gated outlet structure, which consist of a gate tower, a 22-foot-diameter reinforced concrete channel, and a stilling basin, which helps slow down water as it is released from the lake. The second is through an auxiliary spillway located on the west side of the dam.  The spillway structure consists of a concrete barrier wall with a concrete paved chute and side walls. The spillway allows water to flow over the top of the barrier wall during extremely high lake levels. The spillway structure transitions into a natural ground spillway that empties into the Des Moines River approximately a half mile downstream of the dam. The spillway has inflatable gates that when raised can hold back an additional 6 feet of water above the top of the barrier wall. If the reservoir forecast falls within this 6-feet range, the gates are raised and an auxiliary spillway release is prevented. When water levels are expected to be higher than the top of these gates, the gates are lowered, and water passes over the spillway. Saylorville Dam has prevented over $420 million in flood damages and protects more than 50,000 people living and working in the area below the dam. The highest lake elevation observed was in 1993 and was just over 8 feet higher than the crest of the auxiliary spillway. Water has reached the spillway six times, in 1984, 1991, twice in 1993, 2008, and 2010. The 1993 event also released the record amount of water through the dam at 47,000 cubic feet per second, approximately 22% of the design capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2015 and classified the risk associated with Saylorville Dam as low. Water released from the dam could impact densely populated sections of Des Moines with little warning time in the extremely unlikely event of a dam failure. The dam was found to be well-designed, well-constructed, and well-maintained and is expected to be reliable during major floods. However, there is a very remote risk of dam failure from extremely high lake levels eroding areas along the spillway structure or forcing water to seep through the dam around the gated outlet structure. Although highly unlikely, a dam failure would produce a devastating flood with flood depths greater than 15 feet through downtown Des Moines. The flood would inundate a large portion of the City of Des Moines along with several small towns and rural communities along the Des Moines River. Approximately 50,000 people live or work within the worst-case inundation area of the flooding caused by a dam failure.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Saylorville Dam. The dam's Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities' response plan and evacuation procedures. Dam breach flood maps will be available for public viewing on the National Inventory of Dams in late 2021. USACE is developing a detailed communication plan based on the latest risk assessment findings and will engage in communication activities with state and local representatives, stakeholders, emergency managers, and the general public to increase awareness. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam's performance under changing lake levels. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal and high lake levels to ensure the integrity of the dam, identify deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. Lastly, the Des Moines River Master Reservoir Regulation Manual, Water Control Manual for Saylorville Lake was updated in coordination with upstream and downstream stakeholders, to allow the lake to be better managed in terms of earlier reservoir releases ahead of increasing lake levels in an effort to prevent auxiliary spillway releases.",

    "projectDescription": "Flood control structures at the Charles Mill Lake Project includes a rolled earth fill dam with a levee, two dikes, and two uncontrolled concrete overflow sections and outlet works located in the right abutment.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The dam, levee and dikes significantly reduce the risk of flooding to surrounding communities; however, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Although Charles Mill Dam, Pavonia Levee and Dikes 1 and 2 have historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam, levee and dikes operate as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event.  This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillways.  In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the project\u2019s construction.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Charles Mill Dam, Pavonia Levee and Dikes 1 and 2 in 2022 and classified the risk of failure for the entire project system as very low.  The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the spillways have the potential to pass over 21,400 cubic feet of water per second.  The operation of the spillway would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.\n\nWhile the Charles Mill Dam spillway has never flowed, if operated it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Perrysville, OH, to Loudonville, OH.  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, gas, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along the Black Fork of the Mohican River, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows. \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach high elevations quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Charles Mill Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Charles Mill Dam, Pavonia Levee and Dikes 1 and 2. The project is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam, levee, and dikes during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting tabletop exercises and dam safety training with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of the original Mississippi River Lock and Dam 19 was completed by the Mississippi River Power Company in 1913. Upon completion, the lock and dry dock were turned over to the federal government and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while the dam and powerhouse remained under private ownership and control. The original lock, dry dock, powerhouse and dam were placed into service in June 1913. The Mississippi River Power Company was purchased by Union Electric Power Company in 1925 and is currently known as Ameren. The construction of the current lock was completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and placed into service in 1957. Lock and Dam 19 is located on the Mississippi River near Keokuk, Iowa. The project consists of a lock chamber, an abandoned original lock and dry dock closed off by a sheet pile cell structure, a powerhouse, and a movable gate dam. The main lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 38 feet, depending on the river conditions. The powerhouse has a total length of 1,718 feet and contains 15 main generating turbines with a generating capacity of 134 megawatts and 2 house service turbines with a generating capacity of 3.8 megawatts. The dam has an overall length of 4,649 feet and includes 4,278 feet of movable gate section, an east abutment of 290 feet, and a west abutment of 81 feet. The sheet pile cell structure constructed upstream of the original lock and dry dock is 540 feet in length. The dam gates are used in conjunction with the flows through the powerhouse to regulate the Mississippi River for all river conditions.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2023 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 19 as very low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from scour downstream of the dam and failure of the miter gate during ice or debris flushing operations. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 19. USACE operations and engineering staff and Ameren staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The lock, dam, and powerhouse are well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows Ameren staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s joint Emergency Action Plan between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Ameren is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "Lopez Dam is located on Pacoima Wash in the north central part of the San Fernando Valley, within the City and County of Los Angeles. The site is within an area known as Sylmar, a little over a mile north of the Interstate 210 (I-210) and California State Route 118 (SR-118) interchange. The US Army Corps of Engineers built the dam in 1954 to provide flood management of debris-laden floodwaters for the large area between the dam and the Los Angeles River.  The reservoir has been filled with sediment releases from Pacoima Dam multiple time since construction and has been re-excavated each time. Lopez Dam consists of an earthen embankment with outlet works, a diversion structure, an unregulated spillway, and an outlet channel. The top of the dam length is approximately 1,330 feet long and is a maximum height of 45 feet above the original streambed. Flows from the spillway is diverted to channelized Pacoima Wash and navigate approximately 50 miles of channel between Lopez Dam to the Pacific Ocean.",
    "riskCharSummary": "In 2009, USACE conducted a risk assessment for Lopez Dam and the dam was classified as high risk. The combination of life or economic consequences with the likelihood of failure is high and USACE considers this level of life-risk to be unacceptable except in extraordinary circumstances. The assessment identified concerns due to the structural stability of the spillway and for the foundation of the dam. The primary impacted cities are Los Angeles and San Fernando, California. The downstream population at risk is highly urbanized and densely populated. In addition, significant economic consequences would be expected if a failure were to occur.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure USACE is taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises and incorporating any new information into our Emergency Action Plan. USACE closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. USACE is working with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents and schools to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase this monitoring during lake level rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Maintenance is performed on regular basis and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Future risk communication activities include updates to the Emergency Action Plan and coordinating these plans with first responders and development of a formal Risk Communication Plan. USACE will be conducting further study of the dam in 2023.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed West Fork Dam in 1952. West Fork Lake Dam is located on the West Fork of Mill Creek in Cincinnati, OH. The project consists of a 1,100-foot-long earthen embankment with a maximum height of 100 feet, a gate-controlled outlet works along the base of the right abutment, a 2,970 ft long dike along the left abutment, and an uncontrolled open cut spillway through the right abutment. The project reduces flood damages along approximately 6.5 miles of the West Fork of Mill Creek and approximately 18.4 miles of Mill Creek to its confluence with the Ohio River. The dam has a drainage area of 29.5 square miles. The record pool occurred in March 2008 and reached an elevation of 698.2 ft-NAVD88 which is approximately 3.23 feet below spillway crest (EL. 701.43 ft-NAVD88).",
    "riskCharSummary": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment of West Fork Dam in June 2021 that classified the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4 which is considered Low relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities however, it does not eliminate the risk completely. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to result in unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway. There is also a very unlikely scenario that would produce significant flooding which is internal erosion of the dam\u2019s embankment along the conduit. In this scenario, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along Mill Creek.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream communities. The largest impacts would be to the communities of St. Bernard, Wyoming, Arlington Heights, Evendale, Forest Park, Lincoln Heights, Lockland, Reading, Cincinnati, Elmwood Place, Woodlawn, New Richmond, New Burlington, and Pleasant Hills, Ohio. Critical infrastructure potentially impacted include fire stations, schools, emergency medical services, and some electrical power plants.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast, and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather Service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Everett Dam from 1959 to 1962 across the Piscataquog River. The dam holds back water during flood events and works together with nearby Hopkinton Dam to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Merrimack River. Everett Dam normally holds a 15-foot deep, permanent pool that is used to enhance recreation at the project. The dam was built in response to the severe flooding that occurred in the region in 1936. Since it began operations through 2012, the dam reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $79.5 million.\n\nThe dam is made of compacted earth and rock fill and is approximately 11 stories (110 feet) high. An 8-foot diameter concrete pipe called a conduit passes through the dam.  Metal gates at the upstream side of the conduit are opened to allow water to pass through the dam and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events. To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the spillway, a sloped concrete structure located at the eastern end of the dam. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing. The spillway is approximately half the length of a football field and approximately one and a half stories below the top of the dam. Two dikes, also composed of earth and rock fill, with approximate heights equivalent to 5 and 3 stories (50 and 30 feet) were constructed to close off low areas around the reservoir.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Copan Dam in 1980 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities. The dam consists of an earthen embankment and a concrete gated spillway. The project is located on the Little Caney River, a tributary of the Caney River within the Verdigris River watershed, about 9 miles north of Bartlesville, OK. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding in downstream communities along the Caney and Verdigris rivers. This stored water can then be released in a more controlled manner to reduce dangerous flooding.  These releases are regulated by gates inset into the concrete spillway. This project is a portion of the larger flood control measures along the Arkansas River Basin.  Associated with the dam also is levee north of the dam which provides flood protection for the town of Caney, KS.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Copan Dam in 2022 and classified the risk associated with the dam as moderate. The risk is driven by the potential for water to flow over the embankment crest during a very extreme flood event resulting in embankment erosion and breach. Failure of the dam would include downstream flooding, widespread economic impacts, and significant loss of life. In the remote event of a dam failure, the largest impacts would be to the cities of Bartlesville, Claremore, Owasso, and Tulsa.\n\nThere is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation which could include large releases through the gated spillway.  Although the flooding would be less significant during this scenario compared to a dam breach, widespread economic impacts and life loss could still occur depending on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk that is posed to downstream communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the EAP to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. These instruments are monitored regularly for any early indications of potential safety concerns at the project.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Greers Ferry Dam between 1959 and 1962 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities of Heber Springs, Clinton, Searcy, Bald Knob, and Judsonia. The dam is located on the Little Red River in Cleburne County, approximately three miles northeast of Heber Springs, Arkansas. Although reducing the impacts of flooding on downstream communities is the project\u2019s primary purpose, the storage of water in the reservoir behind the dam also provides water supply to nearby communities, recreation, state fishery operations, limited irrigation, and hydropower generation.  \n\nGreers Ferry Dam is a concrete dam northeast of Heber Springs that includes a gated spillway that releases water downstream into the Little Red River. Additionally, two earthen embankments (or dikes) are located southwest of the concrete dam and contribute to retaining, or impounding, Greers Ferry Lake.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Greers Ferry Dam in August of 2020 that characterizes the risks associated with the project as high, which is USACE\u2019s second highest risk category. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although the Greers Ferry Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall and earthquake events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when USACE operates the dam as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction. A less likely scenario would be if one of the gates were to have a problem during operation. In this case, more water than intended could be released, but that additional discharge would be limited to the amount that could pass through one gate. The most devastating potential scenario, but significantly less likely to happen, would occur if the dam were subjected to a large earthquake while the lake level was already high. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled release of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding of Heber Springs and Searcy, Arkansas, and other downstream communities. Greers Ferry Dam has an Emergency Action Plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE performs ongoing inspection, maintenance, and monitoring activities to ensure the integrity of Greers Ferry Dam and to reduce risk to downstream communities. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events. USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam. USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Beach City Dam, Brewster Levee, and Silica Sand Levee in 1937 under approval from the Public Works Administration in 1933. The Flood Control Act of 1939 authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the operation and maintenance for the 14 reservoir projects in the Muskingum River Basin in cooperation with the Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District.  \n\nBeach City Dam is a high hazard dam located in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, on Sugar Creek, a tributary of the Tuscarawas River, 179.8 miles above the mouth of Muskingum River, and 1.5 miles southwest of Beach City, Ohio. Most dams that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages, if breached, would lead to loss of life and/or high economic impacts downstream causing them to be labeled \u201chigh hazard\u201d. Brewster Levee is located 5.5 miles to the northwest of the dam. Silica Sand Levee is located 4 miles to the southwest of the dam. The reservoir forms a conservation pool for flood control, recreation, fish and wildlife, and for maintenance of normal downstream flows during dry periods.\n\nThe earthen dam has a length of 5,600 feet and a height of 68.7 feet and controls a drainage area of 300 square miles. The embankment consists of two sections, the first of which is the main embankment and the second is the Terrace Dike section. In addition, two Dikes were installed (Dike #1 and Dike #2) to prevent reservoir rim overtopping. Two involuntary spillways are located adjacent to the primary spillway that would go into operation during extreme flood events to prevent the dam from overtopping. Between 1937 and 2022, the dam has prevented over $17.6 million dollars in flood damages, which means it prevents about $200K of flood damages per year.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The dam and levees significantly reduce the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although Beach City Dam, Brewster Levee, and Silica Sand Levee have historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream and leveed areas to be flooded. Even when the dam and levees operate as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event. This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillways. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Beach City Dam, Brewster Levee, and Silica Sand Levee in 2023 and classified the risk associated with failure as moderate. This risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely. During such an event, the spillways have the potential to pass over 61,000 cubic feet of water per second. The operation of the spillway would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.\n\nWhile the Beach City Dam spillway has never seen flow, if operated it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Dover, OH to New Philadelphia, OH. Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, gas, and water supply may occur. Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along Sugar Creek, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows. \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach hillside to hillside quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location. In the unlikely event Beach City Dam must pass these extreme waters, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 11 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in May 1937 for the purpose of navigation.  Lock and Dam 11 is located on the Mississippi River at the City of Dubuque, Iowa. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary miter gate bay, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section and a non-submersible earthen dike. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 11 feet, depending on the river conditions. The gated section of the dam has a total length of 1,278 feet. The earthen dike is 3,540 feet long and connects the gated portion of the dam to the Wisconsin shore. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2019 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 11 as very low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from a large flood event overtopping the earthen dike causing a dam failure and a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation.  There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 11. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began construction of Cecil M. Harden Dam in October 1956, and the project became operational in July 1960. Cecil M. Harden Dam is an earthen dam located on Big Raccoon Creek, 34 miles above its junction with the Wabash River. The Cecil M. Harden project consist of a 1,570-foot-long earth embankment dam, a gate-controlled outlet works and an open cut spillway through the left abutment. The project is located approximately 50 miles west of Indianapolis, Indiana in the Wabash River Basin. The project reduces flood damages along approximately 34 miles of the Big Raccoon Creek and more than 130 miles along the Wabash River. At spillway crest elevation, the pool extends from the dam site up Big Raccoon Creek approximately 15.5 miles. The lake has 216 square miles of drainage area above the dam. The record pool elevation of 689.76 feet NAVD88 occurred on 21 July 2015 which resulted in high releases from the dam\u2019s outlet but no discharge from the spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Cecil M. Harden Dam in 2022 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 5 which is considered Very Low relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam provides flood reduction to downstream communities, primarily in the Big Raccoon Creek and Lower Wabash River watersheds. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to result in unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway. There is also a very unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is internal erosion of the dam's earthen embankment during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach of the dam. Another potentially disastrous scenario is erosion of the spillway leading to widening and deepening of the channel. In both of these very unlikely events, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along Big Raccoon Creek and the Wabash River.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream communities. The largest impacts would be to the communities of Ferndale, Mansfield, Bridgeton, Rosedale, Coxville, and Mecca along Big Raccoon Creek. Communities along the Wabash River from Montezuma to Terre Haute would also be impacted. A breach during spillway pool results in damages primarily to residential structures. Further downstream communities are affected less due to the attenuation of flood depths.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast, stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly performs dam inspections and monitors instruments to ensure the health and integrity of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases as the lake approaches spillway crest. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and identify areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Belton Dam in December 1954 in accordance with the Flood Control Act, approved 24 July 1946 (Public Law 526, 79th Congress, Second Session), Section 10. Belton Dam was built on the Leon River to reduce the risk of flooding to the downstream Texas cities of Belton, Temple, and adjacent towns and counties. It is located 3 miles north of the City of Belton in Bell County, Texas.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that holds water in the reservoir, tractor type gates that are operated to control water releases at the dam, and an uncontrolled broadcrested weir spillway, which allows water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir become high. The main dam is made up of soil and rock and is approximately 192 feet (a little over 19 stories) high at a crest elevation of 662.2 feet (NAVD88 vertical datum control).  The rockfill dike stands 30 feet tall and is 418 feet long. The reservoir is kept at or below the conservation pool elevation of 594.2 feet NAVD88 for most of the year. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir until the swollen streams and rivers below the dam recede and can handle the release of stored water minimizing loss of life, property, or the environment. Sometimes water must be released to protect the dam\u2019s integrity even though these streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity.  Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam also provides significant water supply to nearby communities and provides unique recreation opportunities. These benefits significantly improve the quality of life in the area.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To lower the risks associated with the dam, inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam. Surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Normal operation and maintenance are performed regularly to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. The service gates have recently been rehabilitated and are routinely inspected in accordance with USACE guidelines. The performance of Belton Dam is monitored by an instrumentation system and visual inspections, allowing USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as updating, evaluating, and maintaining the current instrumentation program; providing needed maintenance and repairs; and stockpiling materials for emergency flood fighting. The USACE, Fort Worth District personnel work closely with local emergency managers to conduct annual emergency exercises with state and local response teams, provide support for local evacuation plans and updates, and obtain input on Belton Dam Emergency Action Plan annual updates. Risks associated with Belton Dam are communicated annually with stakeholders and emergency managers.",

It is a high hazard potential dam located on Mill Creek, 2.9 miles above its junction with the Eel River. The project is located approximately 40 air miles southwest of Indianapolis and 25 miles east of Terre Haute in Putnam County, Indiana. The project consists of a 900-foot-long embankment with a maximum height of 150 feet, a gate-controlled outlet tunnel through the base of the right abutment, and a 285-foot-wide uncontrolled, open cut spillway on the left abutment. The project reduces flood damages along approximately 2.9 miles of Mill Creek and along the Eel and White River up to its confluence with the Wabash River. The project has a drainage area of approximately 295 square miles. The record pool elevation of 691.71 ft-NAVD88 occurred on 18 June 2008 and did not result in spillway flow (El. 703.6 ft-NAVD88).",

    "projectDescription": "The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initially constructed Charleroi Locks and Dam in 1931 across the Monongahela river and constructed additional features in 1963 to 1967, including steel gates on the dam crest. The dam is located near Charleroi, Pennsylvania, about 41 river miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, PA.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Maxwell Locks and Dam, which is located near Luzerne, Pennsylvania.  The dam consists of a concrete dam with 5 steel gates.  Charleroi was originally constructed with two locks to provide a lift of about 17 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam to the pool above the dam. There is currently only one active lock chamber (land chamber), which is 56 feet wide by 720 feet long with steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The other lock (river chamber) is inactive because it lies within the footprint of ongoing lock replacement construction.  Once construction is complete, Charleroi will have a single lock chamber that will be 84 feet wide by 720 feet long and the current land chamber will be retired.  The dam provides only limited control of the upstream river levels  and does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.  Charleroi locks and dam passes approximately 12 million tons of cargo every year, providing annual benefits of approximately $100 million.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2008, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as high.  The assessment identified one primary scenario that could cause the dam to fail.  During times of normal or high river levels, erosion of the downstream riverbed could destabilize the stilling basin, which consists of a concrete slab situated just downstream of the dam that helps to dissipate the energy of the water flowing over the dam.  If this were to happen, portions of the concrete dam could slide downstream to the extent that the upper pool would be lost (i.e., too low to allow river traffic to continue).  If the upper pool was lost, the main consequence would be the temporary loss of shipping.  Although the dam holds back water, a dam failure at Charleroi will not result in the flooding of downstream communities.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Charleroi Locks and Dam has undergone extensive rehabilitation to mitigate risks.  This rehabilitation includes construction of an extension of the stilling basin downstream of the dam in addition to lock reconstruction.  This work has decreased the primary vulnerability of the dam.  USACE routinely works with stakeholders to communicate risks, and to ensure awareness of any changes regarding the structure. These stakeholders include the Coast Guard, Waterways Association, and the shipping industry.  We conduct emergency exercises with our stakeholders to improve communications and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam or that may adversely affect shipping.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam, particularly of the more vulnerable features.  This monitoring involves inspections and instrumentation that allows us to monitor the stability of the concrete lock and dam structures. The staff maintains a continuous presence and is aware of conditions that could threaten the stability of the structures.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz.\n\n\nConnect with USACE to learn more about the Charleroi Locks and Dam.\n*  Check out information about Charleroi Locks and Dam at: https://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Navigation/Locks-and-Dams/Locks-Dam-4-Mon-River/\n*  Follow the Pittsburgh District on Facebook at: www.facebook.com/PittsburghUSACE/",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed East Branch Dam from 1947 through 1952 across the East Branch of the Clarion River, which created East Branch Lake, whose primary purpose is to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the East Branch of the Clarion River and the Clarion River, including Johnsonburg and Ridgway, Pennsylvania. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $100 million. The reservoir also serves to store rainfall from late winter through early summer and release water to augment river flow during the drier late summer and early autumn months, provide water supply to downstream communities and hydropower generation along the Clarion River, and for recreational purposes.  The dam is composed of an earthen embankment that is a maximum of 184 feet high and approximately 1700 feet long.  The reservoir levels are managed to approved levels throughout the year, normally by means of releases through a concrete tunnel that discharges water to the downstream East Branch of the Clarion River.  To reduce the possibility that the reservoir will overtop the dam, there is a concrete lined spillway at the left end of the embankment dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment was completed in 2022, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as very low. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from East Branch Dam would be a high-volume release over the dam\u2019s spillway (which has only occurred once occurred since the dam began operations in 1952) during an unusually large and intense storm event. The frequency and amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nA less likely, but far more devastating flooding scenario exists:  during an extreme rainfall event, the reservoir level could rise above the top of the embankment dam, causing it to erode to the bottom of the valley and release the entire reservoir volume. \nIn either scenario, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Johnsonburg and Ridgway, located in the valley below the dam, are in more immediate danger in the event of a flood. Towns and cities further downstream have larger populations and less awareness of the dam, but will also have greater warning times, should a flood occur.  With either of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, we will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plan. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. We work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with local residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Woodcock Dam across Woodcock Creek in 1973 to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in the low-lying communities in Saegertown, Meadville, and additional towns in Crawford, Venango, and Mercer County. The dam is located about miles northeast of Meadville, Pennsylvania and forms the Woodcock Creek Lake.  Multiple populations live downstream of Woodcock Dam, including those in Saegertown, Meadville, and other low-lying communities in Crawford, Venango, and Mercer County. Woodcock Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $40 million since its construction. The reservoir stores rainfall to maintain downstream flow within the downstream river banks and releases water after flood events; and provides numerous opportunities for recreation. The reservoir also serves to store rainfall and melted snow during the spring months and releases water to the river in the drier autumn months.   Woodcock Dam is composed of an earthen (embankment) portion and has a maximum height of 90 feet and about 4,600 feet long.  In order to reduce the possibility that the reservoir will overtop the dam, a spillway was constructed beyond the left side of the dam to release a large volume of reservoir water away from the dam during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Woodcock was completed in 2019, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as very low.  The dam was well-constructed and is well-maintained.  The most likely flooding scenario is that high reservoir levels would result in flow through the spillway resulting in downstream flooding during an unusually large and intense storm event.  Water released over the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam had not been constructed.  \n\nTwo less likely, but far more devastating flooding scenarios exist: during an extreme rainfall event, high water levels in the reservoir could cause high water pressure within the dam\u2019s foundation. If this were to occur, the high-pressure water could erode the soils in the dam, which could lead to a breach of the dam.  Alternatively, if the reservoir level rises above the dam crest, water flowing over the embankment dam, could erode the dam, also leading to a breach.  Although such a precipitation event leading to a breach is extremely rare, it is a possibility.\n\nIn either scenario, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Communities, including Saegertown, that are closer to the dam, are in more immediate danger of a significant flood event and may have little advanced warning.  Cities and communities further downstream of the dam, such as Meadville (which has a higher population than Saegertown) and other low-lying communities in Crawford, Venango, and Mercer County possibly have less awareness of the dam but will have more warning. \n\nWith either of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, possibly overflowing banks on the French Creek River destroying buildings and infrastructure.  Anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, we will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plans.  We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently during high-water events.

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 12 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in July 1938 for the purpose of navigation.  Lock and Dam 12 is located on the Mississippi River at the Bellevue, Iowa. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary miter gate bay, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section, a submersible earthen dike spillway, and non-submersible earthen dike sections. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 9 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 8,369 feet, and includes 849 feet of movable gate section, 6,080 feet of non-submersible earthen dike, and 1,440 feet of submersible earthen dike. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in March 2019 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 12 as very low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from a large flood event overtopping the non-submersible earthen dike causing a dam failure and a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation.  There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 12. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Edward MacDowell Dam (originally named the West Peterborough Dam) from 1948 to 1950 across the Nubanusit Brook. The dam holds back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Nubanusit Brook and Contoocook River. Edward MacDowell Dam normally holds a 7-foot deep, permanent, conservation pool. The dam was built in response to the severe flooding that occurred in the region in 1936. Since it began operations through 2013, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $39.5 million.\n\nThe dam is made of compacted earth, rock, and gravel fill and is approximately 7 stories (67 feet) high. A 7-foot by 7-foot concrete pipe called a conduit passes through the dam.  Metal gates at the upstream side of the conduit are opened to allow water to pass through the dam and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events. To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the spillway, a sloped concrete structure located at the 3.2 miles northeast of the dam. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing. The spillway is approximately one third the length of a football field and approximately two stories below the top of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nAlthough Edward MacDowell Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Edward MacDowell Dam is designed to manage peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Edward MacDowell Dam through the ungated spillway during high water events. This type of water release occurs when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Water moving through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a four-story building. While weather can be unpredictable, this type of event can often be predicted 1-2 days before flood waters would impact downstream communities. USACE will engage state emergency managers when such an event is forecasted and support actions to get people to safety.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment in 2023 and classified the risks associated with the Edward MacDowell Dam as low. This classification is based on the large population that lives immediately downstream of the dam in Peterborough, NH as well as other communities downstream. Three unlikely, but devastating scenarios that would produce significant downstream flooding are breach of the dam due to water flowing over the top of the dam; breach due to flow over the top of the dike, or scour of the impervious core into the bedrock below. In the case of an extremely rare and large rain event, water could potentially flow over the top of the dam or the dike, which could cause erosion of the earthen embankment, and breach of the dam or dike. In addition, it is possible, but very unlikely, that during a high pool, the soil of the embankment could move into cracks in the bedrock, which could eventually cause the crest to settle.  In these scenarios,  Peterborough, HIllsborough, Henniker, and Manchester, NH, along with other communities along the Merrimack River, would be the most impacted with a potential incremental life loss of between 100 to 1000 people.  Downstream flooding in Peterborough would occur less than an hour after of breach and the rapidly moving water could be as deep as 25 feet, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nEdward MacDowell Dam is staffed full time.  During high pools, it is inspected on a daily basis.  When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The Dalles Lock & Dam is located on the Columbia River 2 miles upstream of The Dalles, Ore., and 22 miles upstream of Hood River, Ore.  The Dalles Lock & Dam is a 200 ft tall, 8,735 ft long concrete gravity dam with a concrete spillway with twenty-three spillway gates, a navigation lock, two fishways, and a powerhouse. The Dalles Lock & Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1952 and was completed in 1957.  The powerhouse began operation in 1960 with additional hydroelectric capacity added in 1972. The Dalles Lock & Dam is located at the downstream end of Columbia River watershed, which is approximately the size of France (240,000 square miles). Once a river with large fluctuations in flow throughout the year, the flow is regulated by hundreds of dams upstream including large reservoirs in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Canada. The Dalles Lock & Dam is specifically authorized to provide hydropower, navigation, irrigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a routine risk assessment for The Dalles Lock & Dam in 2018 that characterized the risk associated with the dam to be Low. The assessment considered a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure.    \n\nUSACE is confident that its dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to provide significant benefits for the region. Dams help to reduce flood risks. However, dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams.  Flooding can be caused by high flows from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams.  The Dalles Lock & Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance.  USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. The Dalles Lock & Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be low.

This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of New Cumberland Locks and Dam across the Ohio River in 1961.  The dam is located in Stratton, OH, about 54 miles downstream of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Montgomery Locks and Dam, located near Monaca, Pennsylvania. The dam is concrete and includes eleven gated bays through which the Ohio River flows. The locks provide a lift of about 21 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The locks allow river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The locks include a main chamber that is 110 feet wide by 1200 feet long and a second, auxiliary chamber, that is 110 feet wide by 600 feet long.  The lock chambers are adjacent to each other and are formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The pool created by the dam also provides water supply to municipal and industrial intakes, and recreational purpose. The total benefits to the region are more than 470 million dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2018, which characterized the risk as low. The assessment identified two scenarios that could cause the dam to fail, which would release water from the upper pool: 1) A runaway barge could become trapped on the dam which could prevent one or more dam gates from closing; and 2) The riverbed downstream of the dams could erode to the extent that portions of the dam move downstream. Either of these scenarios, although very unlikely could result in a loss of the upper pool to the extent that river traffic would be halted.  If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequences would be the loss of shipping and water supply, which would damage the regional economy by more than 470 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping and water supply.  Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure all steps are being taken to reduce the risk to the economy, we conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the riverbed and locks and dam.  We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communications and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam\u2019s upper pool or may adversely affect river traffic.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We also communicate with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and the changes to the lock operations. We closely follow rainfall forecasts and river levels to determine when high river events may occur, in order to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We also maintain good communications with industry to remove barges that may run aground near or on our dams.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Sardis Dam in 1940 and continues to own, operate, and maintain the facility today. Located across the Little Tallahatchie River, the dam helps control flooding along the Yazoo River Basin for more than 19,000 residents and more than 8,400 homes and businesses totaling nearly $13 Million.  The dam also provides water-based and other outdoor recreation opportunities. The 117-foot-tall, earthen-filled dam is located four miles north of Sardis, Mississippi, and is approximately 15,300 feet (over 3 miles) long.  \n\nSardis Dam and Reservoir is managed throughout the year to store and slowly release water to help keep the downstream Little Tallahatchie River within its banks and to reduce the peak flow of rainfall runoff. The lake is drawn down during the fall and winter to provide needed storage during periods of prevalent rainfall. The lake is filled during the spring and summer to provide recreational opportunities to the visiting public. This management is in accordance with the project\u2019s congressionally authorized Water Control Plan. \n\nReservoir water is released into the Little Tallahatchie River through a concrete tunnel in the dam controlled by 4 large gates. These gates can release enough water to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in nine seconds. The dam\u2019s overflow spillway is located on its north side and is designed to pass high volumes of flood waters to prevent the dam from being overtopped and breaking. On rare occasions when the spillway is activated, the water passes over a concrete rim and down a 400-foot-wide concrete slope into the spillway outlet channel and eventually back into the Little Tallahatchie River. This overflow spillway can release enough water to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in less than one second. Sardis Lake has overflowed the overflow spillway three times since the dam was constructed, with the most recent overflow occurring in 1991. \n\nSardis Dam embankment was constructed using a rare method called hydraulic filling. This method used a slurry consisting of dredge material and water to pump to the area of the dam and allow the specified sediments to settle out, creating the dam embankment. Since there is no mechanical compaction, the only means of compaction is the weight of the embankment itself. Poor embankment compaction and poor soil strength create a problem for the seismic stability of the embankment. Sardis Dam sits on the edge of the New Madrid seismic zone, which could induce significant shaking at the structure if an earthquake were to occur. A similarly constructed dam in Southern California had significant settlement after an earthquake in 1971 which caused the crest of the dam to settle almost 30 feet. This incident initiated multiple earthquake studies at similarly constructed dams, including Sardis Dam. The site-specific study resulted in implementation of two separate earthquake mitigation measures. 1st, a rock berm was placed on the upstream toe of the dam to decrease the chance of slope failure during an earthquake in that location. This berm can be seen near the center of the dam during winter pools. 2nd, concrete pilings were driven through the toe of the embankment and into the foundation soils in order to transfer earthquake loads to more suitable material.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Sardis Dam greatly reduces flood risks downstream, it does not eliminate these risks. Flooding can still occur even if Sardis Dam operates as designed. Unlikely but possible storm scenarios exist that could cause more rainfall than Sardis Dam can safely store. To pass such a large amount of water, the dam gates may need to be fully opened; and the dam\u2019s overflow spillway may activate to pass extreme flow events to keep Sardis Dam from overtopping and breaking. If the overflow spillway was to activate due to a major storm, two-to-six feet of water could flood the Mississippi Delta as far west as Clarksdale and as far south as Greenwood and Indianola. This water would likely flood farm fields and low-lying areas.  As much as six-to-fifteen feet of water could be expected near the Little Tallahatchie River in Panola County along Interstate 55 and US Hwy 6 with two-to-six feet of water expected near the Little Tallahatchie, Tallahatchie, and Yazoo Rivers in Panola, Quitman, and Tallahatchie Counties.  While weather can be unpredictable, spillway events can often be forecasted one-to-two days before flooding begins to impact communities. USACE is in routine communication with the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) to ensure the proper precautions are taken. \n\nIn 2022, Sardis Dam was assessed for any concerns that might cause the dam to fail during rare events. USACE has classified the risks of failure associated with Sardis Dam as high. During this assessment, several deficiencies were noted for further investigation, but the dam has performed as designed since its construction in 1940. Certain large storm events like those seen in March 2019 could cause Sardis Lake to rise and cause downstream flooding.  Increased reservoir levels could also drive foundation pressures high enough to damage the outlet works and potentially cause failure.  Additionally, cracking of the dam\u2019s concrete conduit could allow foundation soils to erode back and threaten the integrity of the dam and lead to failure. \n\nIf Sardis Dam breached or failed, flood waters would be deep and swift enough to damage and destroy houses, buildings, roads, bridges, power, water supplies, and even cause loss of life. The impacts of the dam\u2019s failure would be extensive throughout the Mississippi Delta region. The flooded area would be similar in size to the area impacted by the Yazoo Backwater Flood in 2019 but would be deeper and far more encompassing. In the unlikely event that Sardis Dam breaches, follow all directions from your local emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.  To prepare your family against possible flooding, please visit the National Inventory of Dams (NID) website to see maps showing the potential extent of flooding locations if Sardis Dam were to breach.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure Sardis Dam continues to minimize flood risks while balancing all its project functions, USACE uses the latest rainfall forecasts and stream gauge information to model lake stages and potential downstream impacts. USACE regularly inspects the dam and routinely reassesses its risks. \n\n \n\nTo address risks identified in a recent assessment, USACE performed joint grouting work in the conduit to attempt to eliminate movement of foundation material through two conduit joints. USACE is currently monitoring seepage pressures along the conduit and beneath the dam. USACE also plans to replace the outlet works drainage system to help control foundation seepage pressures more effectively and investigate the potential for deformation of the main dam due to seismic loading and remediate any areas identified. These deficiencies and repairs will be further investigated by USACE experts to assess the need for further remediation that would decrease the total risk of the project.  \n\n \n\nUSACE coordinates closely with the National Weather Service (NWS), the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam. USACE continues to work with these agencies to prepare and practice for emergency response efforts related to Sardis Dam. Close coordination with local and state emergency management officials allows agency personnel to act in a timely manner during an emergency. \n\n \n\nDuring high-water events, USACE dam safety professionals increase surveillance of the dam to 24 hours a day and are prepared to act if an issue occurs. USACE personnel also continually monitor river conditions to help optimize the dam\u2019s operations.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no estimated potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "Oahe Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Operating since 1962, it is the third-most upstream of six projects built on the mainstem of the upper Missouri River which, in combination with dams on the river\u2019s tributaries, reduce the risk of downstream flooding along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, this \u201cmainstem\u201d system of dams is managed to balance hydropower generation, water supply, water quality, irrigation, fish and wildlife conservation, navigation, and recreation benefits.  \n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet structure for releasing stored water, a powerhouse, and eight spillway gates used to release excess water during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, USACE releases up to 54,000 cubic feet of water per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons) through the powerhouse to manage reservoir elevations and generate power. As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, water also is released through six tunnels in the outlet structure which, combined, can release up to 111,000 cfs. When reservoir levels from extreme storms or snowmelt exceed the outlet structure\u2019s release capacity, additional releases can be  made using the spillway gates to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to release an additional 304,000 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release. Spillway releases have never been required.\n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Oahe Dam as a result of flooding was approximately 160,000 cfs from the outlet structure and powerhouse in 2011. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Oahe Dam continues to reliably reduce floods but it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can the system of dams in which it operates). While unlikely, a non-breach release when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n \nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threats that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, are instability of the foundation under the dam embankment, damage to the spillway during non-breach releases, and overtopping. Although these scenarios are very unlikely, failure of the dam or spillway would require historic water releases from the downstream Missouri River dams (Big Bend, Fort Randall, and Gavins Point) to preserve their structural integrity. In an extreme case, water from Oahe could exceed the storage capacities of these dams, leading to overtopping and \u201ccascading\u201d dam failures. Over the course of days to weeks, these flows would result in swift, deep, and life-threatening flooding in numerous communities (both with and without levees) along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities).\n\nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Oahe Dam as \u201chigh\u201d among its more than 700 dams due to the potential loss of life and large, national-scale consequences in the very unlikely event that a breach occurs. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure. Please note that some scenarios in this database for the six USACE dams on the upper Missouri River do not depict the full extent of downstream inundation including the extent of \u201ccascading\u201d inundation that could develop from upstream Missouri River dam failure(s). For more information on the USACE Dam Safety Program and risk assessments, visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Ongoing Actions:  The USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks. For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.\n\nActions at Oahe Dam:  While USACE continues to evaluate how to further reduce the risks associated with Oahe Dam, several risk reduction measures were completed after flooding in 2011. These included adding drains to further stabilize the dam\u2019s foundation, additional instrumentation to enhance foundation monitoring, and the use of state-of-the-art surveying technology to improve monitoring of the spillway and embankment. To reduce the probability of overtopping USACE also removed sediment that restricted flow through the spillway.  \n\nBuilding Awareness:  Since dams do not eliminate flood risk, communities downstream of USACE\u2019s Missouri River dams are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to their family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.

    "projectDescription": "Lookout Point Dam is located on the Middle Fork of the Willamette River 22 miles upstream of Eugene and Springfield, Oregon. Lookout Point Dam is a 246ft tall, 1,875ft long rockfill earthen embankment dam with a concrete spillway, five spillway gates, a concrete non-overflow section, and a powerhouse with regulating outlets. Lookout Point dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1948 and was completed in 1954. Lookout Point Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, produce hydropower, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season. Lookout Point Dam is downstream of Hills Creek Dam and upstream of Dexter Dam.\n\nLookout Point Dam is located about 75 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. The assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. USACE is conducting advanced risk assessments, called Issue Evaluation Studies (IES), at several Willamette Valley Project dams including Lookout Point Dam.\n\nAs of May 2019, results of the advanced study for Lookout Point Dam identified the risk associated with the dam to be Moderate. The risk is driven by the high population downstream of the dam combined with two possible, but very unlikely events: 1) an extreme earthquake occurring at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest or 2) an extreme flood event that fills the reservoir at a rate faster than the dam can pass water through the spillway. According to the study, an extreme earthquake could cause the spillway gates and the concrete supports on either side to become damaged. If this occurs when the reservoir is at its highest, the damaged gates may no longer be able to hold back the water, allowing a high volume of water to flow through the spillway and cause flooding of areas downstream. The study also determined that an extreme and very unlikely rainfall event could fill the reservoir at a rate faster than the spillway is able to pass flow through the dam, allowing the reservoir to rise above the top of the embankment dam. As water flows over the top of the dam, the speed and depth of the water could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam. As the soil and rock continue to erode, more water is allowed to pass over and through the dam at greater speeds and depths, causing significant flooding downstream. Because Lookout Point Dam is located upstream of Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, there is potential for flooding to affect large downstream populations in urban areas and surrounding suburbs, as well as rural communities in the floodplain areas. USACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The likelihood is very low for an extreme earthquake to occur, and very low for an extreme rainfall event that could overtop the dam to occur, but the potential impacts of a dam failure are very high due to the large downstream population. Immediate action is therefore warranted to reduce risk to acceptable levels. Interim risk reduction measures (IRRMs) were implemented in spring 2020 to reduce life-safety risk while issues are studied further. These measures include reducing the maximum conservation pool (summer refill target) of Lookout Point reservoir by 5 feet. A modification study is underway that will address replacement of the spillway gates in order to reduce the likelihood that they become damaged during an earthquake. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Lookout Point Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Lookout Point Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The US Army Corps of Engineers completed the construction of RD Bailey Dam in 1980. The project was authorized as the Justice Reservoir Project by the Flood Control Act of 1962 (H.R. 13273, PL 87-874, 87th Congress, second session). The authorized project purposes include flood risk management, water quality control, recreation, and fish and wildlife. The total cost to build the dam was $180 Million.  It has prevented over $470 Million in flood damages since construction. \n\nR.D. Bailey Dam is located on the Guyandotte River approximately 112 miles above the mouth of the river at its confluence with the Ohio River at Huntington, West Virginia. The project is in Mingo County, WV approximately one mile upstream of Justice, WV. \n\nThe dam is a rolled rock embankment dam with an upstream concrete facing, intake tower, tunnel, and stilling basin and includes an uncontrolled broad-crested partially lined saddle spillway. The dam has a maximum height of 310 feet above the streambed and an overall length of 1,397 feet. The crest width of the dam is 32 feet with a maximum base width of approximately 1,250 feet. Normal outflow is controlled through gates on the intake structure and flow into the 18-foot diameter tunnel through the dam\u2019s left abutment. The spillway is an uncontrolled saddle that is over the ridge from the dam\u2019s right abutment. \n\nThe dam helps regulate waters coming from the Guyandotte River in the 540 square mile drainage area upstream of the dam. The dam helps to provide flood risk management all along the Guyandotte River including Justice, Gilbert, Logan, Barboursville, and Huntington, West Virginia and helps to provide flood risk management for the Ohio River downstream of Huntington, West Virginia. RD Bailey Dam provides waters to keep downstream rivers flowing. However, when it is projected that the Guyandotte or Ohio Rivers may cause flooding, water coming from upstream of the dam is stored until streams and rivers downstream of the dam recede. Typically storm waters can be released in a controlled manner to reduce flood impacts downstream. However, there are rare storms which can cause more rainfall and runoff than RD Bailey Dam can store safely. When this occurs, the dam\u2019s uncontrolled spillway will begin to release or spill these waters to reduce the chance that the dam could be overtopped. \n\nWhen the dam is not storing flood waters to reduce flood risks downstream, the dam operates to impound water for recreation. This lake is raised in the warmer months to support boat access and lowered in the winter months for additional flood storage.",
    "riskCharSummary": "A 2021 risk assessment for RD Bailey Dam classified it as having low risk of failure during a flood. Although risks associated with a breach or failure are low, the dam does not completely eliminate flood risks downstream.  Flooding can still occur even if RD Bailey Dam is operating as designed.  There are extremely rare (but possible) storms that could cause more rainfall than the dam can safely store.  During such an event, the open spillway to the right (North) of the dam has the potential to pass up to 450 thousand cubic feet of water per second, or more than four times the amount of flow over Niagara Falls.  The operation of the spillway would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching. \n\nWhile the RD Bailey Dam spillway has never flowed, if operated it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Justice and Gilbert, WV to Huntington, WV.  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along the Guyandotte River, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows. \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach hillside to hillside quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event RD Bailey Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at RD Bailey Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with USACE staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed CW Bill Young Lock and Dam (aka Allegheny 3 Lock and Dam) across the Allegheny River in 1934.  The dam is located near Oakmont, Pennsylvania, about 15 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, PA.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Allegheny Lock and Dam 4, which is located near Tarentum, PA. The dam consists of a concrete spillway section, which means that the river flows freely over it.  The lock provides a lift of about 14 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam to the pool above the dam.  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The lock gates are supported by steel anchorage frames embedded in the concrete lock walls, which work similarly to hinges on a door. The economic benefit of shipping materials and goods through the lock is more than 15 million dollars annually.  Additionally, the upper pool is a source of water supply for nearby communities, amounting to more than 6 million dollars each year.  There are no means of controlling the flow over the dam and the dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.  The pool created by the dam also provides recreation opportunities for metropolitan Pittsburgh.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2023, which characterized the risk as very low. The assessment identified one primary scenario that could halt river traffic.  When the river is at normal levels, the lock gate anchorage (similar to a hinge on a door) could break and prevent the gate from closing.  If this were to happen, river traffic would be halted until the gate anchorage could be replaced, which could take 1.5 months to 6 months depending on the damage to the anchorage and lock gate. In this scenario, both the upper pool and the lower pool would be unaffected and there would be no resulting flooding on the  Allegheny River.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. When we determine that our lock gates are at risk of failure, we take action to replace them and any vulnerable components as quickly as possible.  We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communication and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam or that may adversely affect shipping.  We regularly update our emergency action plan. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the nearby riverbed, lock, and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Allegheny 4 Lock and Dam in 1927 across the Allegheny River.  The dam is located near Natrona Pennsylvania, about 24 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, PA.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam to Allegheny 5 Lock and Dam, which is located near Freeport, PA. The dam consists of a concrete spillway section, which means that the river flows freely over it.  The lock provides a lift of about 11 feet, which is the height of the river level behind the dam above the river level downstream of the dam.  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The economic benefits of shipping materials and goods through the lock is more than 7 million dollars annually.  There are no means of controlling the flow over the dam and the dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.  Local communities use the pool upstream of the dam for water supply.  The pool created by the dam provides recreation opportunities for metropolitan Pittsburgh.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2023, which characterized the risk as very low. The assessment identified one primary, but very unlikely scenario that could cause the dam to fail.  If the riverbed downstream of the dam were to erode deeply, a portion of the concrete dam could slide downstream and release the water in the pool upstream of the dam.  Although this scenario is very unlikely, it would most likely occur during a time of normal river levels.  If the pool upstream of the dam is released, river navigation would be halted, resulting in a loss of economic benefits to the region of more than 9 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping, water supply, and boat recreation.  Although this scenario is possible, the dam has performed well for over 90 years without incident and there are no indications that the downstream riverbed is eroding in a manner that would threaten the dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public and the economy, we conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communications and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam\u2019s upper pool or may adversely affect navigation.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We also communicate with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and any changes to lock operations.   We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam, including periodic comprehensive inspections, the most recent of which was conducted in 2023.  Based on observations of possible riverbed erosion downstream of the dam after the 2018 inspection, USACE undertook a careful inspection of the area in 2020.  This inspection indicated that there has been no recent erosion at the dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts and river levels to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications.

    "projectDescription": "Pipestem Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Completed in 1973 on Pipestem Creek, it was the second of two dams built by USACE and the Bureau of Reclamation to reduce risks from flooding in Jamestown, N.D. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, USACE manages water releases for recreation and to support fish and wildlife. Water storage and its release from Pipestem Lake are coordinated with Reclamation (who owns Jamestown Dam and Reservoir, about 6 miles east and also in the James River Basin). \n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet structure for releasing stored water, and a spillway over which water can flow during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, USACE releases stored water through the outlet structure for downstream users and flows are generally less than 200 cubic feet per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons). As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, USACE  uses the outlet structure to manage reservoir elevations and can release up to 2,300 cfs. When reservoir levels from extreme storms or snowmelt exceed the outlet structure\u2019s release capacity, water can flow through the spillway to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to pass an additional 56,200 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release. The reservoir has never been high enough for spillway flow.\n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Pipestem Dam as a result of flooding was approximately 1,400 cfs from the outlet structure in 2009. (With the inclusion of 1,800 cfs released from Jamestown Dam, downstream flow through Jamestown reached 3,200 cfs in 2009.) It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Pipestem Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can Jamestown Dam). While unlikely, a non-breach release when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n\nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threat that could lead to a dam breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, is damage to the spillway during non-breach releases. Although this scenario is unlikely\u2014less than 1 chance in 300 years\u2014, failure of the spillway would result in catastrophic flooding with swift, deep, and life-threatening floodwaters in many parts of Jamestown and communities along the James River. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities).   \n\nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Pipestem Dam as \u201chigh\u201d among its more than 700 dams due to the downstream consequences in Jamestown and Lamoure, ND, from potential failure of the spillway during an extreme event. . This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure. For more information on the USACE Dam Safety Program and risk assessments, visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program\n.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Ongoing Actions:  The USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks.  For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.\n\nActions at Pipestem Dam: As a responsible dam owner, USACE completed a Dam Safety Modification Study in 2020 to evaluate opportunities to further reduce risks at the dam. As a result, construction of spillway modifications will begin in 2023, with completion scheduled for the end of 2026. Modifications will make the spillway significantly more resistant to erosion during large releases of water. Where practical, USACE will also take advantage of opportunities during spillway construction to reduce risk in other parts of the dam.  For more information visit: https://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake-Projects/Pipestem-Dam-Lake-North-Dakota/. \n\nBuilding Awareness:  Since dams do not eliminate flood risk, Jamestown and other downstream communities are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.",

    "projectDescription": "Ray Roberts Dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1987 near Aubrey, Texas. USACE operates the Ray Roberts Dam for flood damage reduction, water supply, recreation, fish and wildlife and water quality. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damages caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $41.6 billion (adjusted to 2020 dollars). Ray Roberts Dam consists of an earthen embankment that serves as the main water barrier; an outlet works consisting of lifting gates that allow controlled water flow out of the dam; and a spillway that allows water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir exceed the available flood storage. The dam is almost three miles long and as tall as a 14-story building and is made up of rock and soil. The spillway crest is about 20 feet lower than the highest part of the dam and can pass up to 108,500 gallons per second, enough water to flood a football field a foot deep every four seconds.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Ray Roberts Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding due to floodwaters passed through the dam are high volume releases from the operation of Ray Roberts Dam during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded causing flooding in areas adjacent to the reservoir and excess water flows through the spillway and/or outlet works. Ray Roberts Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. Generally, the Elm Fork Trinity River's large floods are a long-duration type, lasting weeks or even months; however, it is possible that large peak and volume floods could occur within a two-week duration. Despite the flood reduction benefits the dam provides, very rare, severe storms could produce high surcharge releases with the potential to impact the communities of Lewisville, Coppell, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving, and Dallas.\n\nIn May 2019, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment to evaluate the potential hazards to the dam, expected performance, and associated consequences and classified the risk associated with Ray Roberts Dam as moderate. Risk for Ray Roberts Dam is driven by an extremely unlikely flood event, unlike anything ever experienced in the area, resulting in water flowing over the top of the dam, potentially leading to erosion of the embankment and an eventual dam breach. While this event is unlikely, consequences include the potential for high loss of life. The primary impacted areas during such an event would be the cities of Denton, Lewisville, Dallas, and the adjacent communities. There would also be significant economic loss and damages to both residential and commercial areas. Should a breach occur flood water released from Ray Roberts Dam would flow into the reservoir at Lewisville Dam (TX00008) and Lake Lewisville would rise rapidly flooding the surrounding communities. The elevated floodwaters would pass through the Lewisville Dam gated outlet structure initially and eventually would flow over the ungated spillway resulting in downstream flooding. Lewisville Dam could also overtop and potentially breach under this scenario and the resulting floodwater would increase downstream damages and the potential for loss of life. It is likely during a flood event of this magnitude the potential risk of overtopping would be forecast in advance. Although large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans; local emergency managers who are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure; and local emergency managers who meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, a breach of the dam would jeopardize thousands of people\u2019s lives within the inundated area.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes; regularly updating the Ray Roberts Dam Emergency Action Plan; and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures, such as filling low spots across the top of the dam, clearing vegetation from the sides of the dam, conducting regular surveillance of the dam, and are currently considering automating instrumentation. USACE is currently reassessing risk at the spillway based on recommendation that a field investigation would increase confidence in the 2019 risk assessment results. Fort Worth District regularly inspects and monitors instruments that help ensure that the structure is performing as intended and help detect potential concerns. The frequency of these dam inspections increases when the lake level rises. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Surry Mountain Dam in 1939 to 1941 across the Ashuelot River. Surry Mountain Dam holds a 260-acre recreation pool outside of flood events. The dam holds back additional water during flood events and works together with nearby Otter Brook Dam to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Ashuelot and Connecticut Rivers. The dam was built in response to the severe flooding that occurred in the region in the 1930\u2019s. Since it began operations, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $541 million.\n\nThe dam is made of compacted earth and rock fill and is approximately 9 stories (86 feet) high. A 10-foot diameter concrete pipe called a conduit passes through the dam.  Metal gates at the upstream side of the conduit are opened to allow water to pass through the dam and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events. To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the spillway, a sloped concrete structure located at the west end of the dam. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing. The spillway is approximately one football field in length and approximately two stories below the top of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Surry Mountain Dam in 2018 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Moderate. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Surry Mountain Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist. \n\nThere are also two extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would result in failure of the dam and downstream flooding:  (1) A flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded, resulting in  flows over the top of the dam, even with maximum possible releases being made through the conduit, and (2) a flood so large that water flowing over the spillway damages the spillway structure. Were either of these events to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Keene, Swanzey, Winchester, and Hinsdale, NH are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities further downstream, including Hartford, CT would also be impacted, but less so. \n\nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges. In a worst case scenario, you could see water higher than a two story building.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists at Surry Mountain Dam. Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we are taking actions to further reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of Surry Mountain Dam and will modify operations if we feel there is risk to the public. We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner. USACE is planning for additional studies to further understand the risk associated with Surry Mountain Dam, and what, if any, actions can be completed to reduce the risk.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Keystone Dam in 1964 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Keystone Dam is located on the Arkansas River about 15 miles west of Tulsa. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  After the storm passes and the Arkansas River level recedes, the water can be safety released into the river.  Water storage and releases are managed by a large gated spillway.  This spillway is flanked on each side by concrete dam sections and earthen embankments.  The project also includes a hydroelectric power plant that began operating in 1968 that generates power for the community.  In addition to the power generated at the dam itself, the project provides water supply for the Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) power plant located downstream along the Arkansas River.  Keystone Dam also provides navigation benefits along the Arkansas River and various recreation benefits.  Associated with the dam is also Cleveland Levee, located upstream of the dam and within the reservoir. Cleveland Levee reduces flood risk to the City of Cleveland, Oklahoma due to high reservoir levels and high river flows.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2023 and classified the risk associated with Keystone Dam as high.  The risk is primarily driven by 1.) the potential for a very rare flood to occur causing water to flow over the top of the dam resulting in breach and 2.) The potential for a large release through the gates to cause erosion immediately downstream of the concrete dam causing a section of the dam to rotate or slide downstream resulting in additional flooding.  The potential for the dam\u2019s gates to become inoperable during a flood was also considered during the assessment.  If the gates did not operate as intended, it would reduce the capability to release water which could contribute to the potential for water to flow over the top of the dam.  The risk is also increased due to the large populations living downstream of the dam that would be flooded in the event of a failure.  \n\nFailure of the dam would include catastrophic flooding downstream, widespread economic impacts, and significant loss of life.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the cities of Sand Springs (including those areas behind the Tulsa West Tulsa Levee System), Tulsa, Jenks (including those areas behind the Jenks Levee System), Bixby, Muskogee, and other communities along the Arkansas River. Bridges crossing the Arkansas River and key infrastructure along the river from Sand Springs to Webbers Falls could also be damaged or destroyed. \n\nA more likely flooding scenario includes a large release through the gated spillway during a flood with the project operating as intended.   Although the inundation would not be as great as a breach of the dam, this scenario could still result in widespread economic impacts and loss of life due to the extent of the flooding possible as part of normal operation of the dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Keystone Dam poses to the community.  A dam safety modification study is underway to evaluate alternatives to potentially modify the dam to directly reduce risk.  \nThere are numerous additional activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam to build awareness of flood risk.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "Bear Creek Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Operating since 1982 on Bear Creek, upstream of its confluence with the South Platte River in suburban Lakewood, Colorado, it is the third of three \u201ctri-lakes\u201d dams built by USACE to collectively reduce risks from flooding in the Denver metropolitan area. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, USACE manages water releases from this tri-lakes system for recreation, water quality, and to support fish and wildlife.\n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet structure for releasing stored water, and a spillway over which excess water can flow during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, the outlet structure releases water to downstream users and flows are generally less than 100 cubic feet per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons). As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, the outlet structure is used to manage reservoir elevations and can release up to 2,100 cfs. When reservoir levels from extreme storms or snowmelt exceed the outlet structure\u2019s release capacity, water can flow through the spillway to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to additionally pass  up to 153,500 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release. The reservoir has never been high enough for spillway flow.\n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Bear Creek Dam as a result of flooding was approximately 800 cfs from the outlet structure in 1980. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Bear Creek Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can the system of dams in which it operates). While unlikely, a non-breach release when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n\nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threats that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, are overtopping and erosion of the dam\u2019s foundation from water flowing beneath the embankment. Although the likelihood of these scenarios is extremely unlikely, failure of the dam or spillway would result in swift, deep, and life-threatening flooding in many parts of the Denver metropolitan area and communities along Bear Creek and the South Platte River. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities).   \n\nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Bear Creek Dam as \u201cmoderate\u201d among its more than 700 dams due\u2013should a breach occur\u2013to the consequences to the highly urbanized downstream communities where the population has significantly increased since the dam was built. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure.  For more information on the USACE Dam Safety Program and risk assessments, visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Ongoing Actions: The USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks.  For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.\n\nActions at Bear Creek Dam: While USACE continues to evaluate how to further reduce the risks associated with Bear Creek Dam, several risk reduction actions were completed including improvements to runoff forecast models in coordination with the National Weather Service to accelerate public warnings from local emergency management agencies.\n\nBuilding Awareness: Since dams do not eliminate flood risk, communities downstream of Denver-area dams are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to their family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Inundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.  More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Lock & Dam 4 in 1935.  The project is located on the Mississippi River in Alma, Wisconsin. USACE operates Lock & Dam 4 primarily for navigation purposes, but congress also authorized USACE to make recreation improvements associated with the pool formed above the dam. Additionally, environmental management on the river is coordinated with the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources, and other state & federal agencies. The main components of the project include a lock, a gated spillway structure with 6 roller gates and 22 Tainter gates, and 1.1 miles of earthen embankments connecting these other components. The embankment has a crest elevation of 677.6 feet (NAVD 88) and a maximum height of 29 feet.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Mississippi River Lock and Dam 4 is a run-of-river dam that maintains a navigation pool for river traffic but does not store flood waters. The gated spillway is regulated to hold a constant pool level for navigation purposes at elevation 666.4 (feet, NAVD88) up to river flows of 89,000 cubic feet per second (cfs).  The 89,000 cfs has an annual chance of exceedance of about 60% each year.  Above this flow, the gates are fully opened and the dam has less than 1.3 feet of impact on the river stages. The maximum water level differential across the dam is 7 feet and occurs at low river flows.  Based upon a risk assessment in 2023, USACE considers Mississippi River Lock and Dam 4 to have very low incremental risk in the event of a breach.  Normal actions are programmed for routine dam safety activities, operations and maintenance.   The risk assessment considered 72 failure modes with specific attention to deterioration of low-flow conduits through the embankment, corrosion of roller gates in the spillway, and towboat accidents impacting either the auxiliary lock miter gates or the spillway gates.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.   Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Other hazards exist, such as swimming and boat safety in the vicinity of the dam.  USACE regularly engages the public to raise awareness of the dam; and coordinates with state and county emergency managers (particularly during river flood events).",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District completed constructed Whittier Narrows Dam in 1957 by the spanning the San Gabriel River and Rio Hondo, near the cities of Pico Rivera and Montebello in Los Angeles County, California. The dam\u2019s primary purpose is to reduce the risk of flooding to more than 1 million people and an estimated $18 billion in property. In addition to flood risk management, Whittier Narrows Reservoir is used for recreation and water conservation in partnership with local agencies. Whittier Narrows Dam is made of compacted soil and rock. Overall, it is more than three miles long, and the top of the dam is about 55 feet above the Rio Hondo streambed. The reservoir is normally dry most of the year, but it is designed to capture water from storm events, which tend to be of short duration and high intensity. Whittier Narrows Dam is part of a complex waterway system that consists of several dams, levees and channels from the San Gabriel Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. Water flows along the San Gabriel River into the Whittier Narrows reservoir and exits into two rivers, the San Gabriel River and the Rio Hondo. Controlled releases are normally routed through the Rio Hondo\u2019s four outlet gates, and as needed, through the San Gabriel River Spillway gates, with only the amount of water the downstream channels can hold. The spillway structure is located to the east, on the San Gabriel River, and consists of nine large gates, which were designed to automatically operate in order to protect the dam from overtopping. This operation is needed to protect the earthen embankment of the dam from failure during extreme storm events, when the reservoir has the potential for filling up beyond its capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "In August 2019, USACE completed a safety study of Whittier Narrows Dam and classified the risk as extremely high. Although unlikely, a couple of dam failure scenarios triggered by rare, extremely high rainfall events, could lead to significant downstream flooding. These scenarios could occur when water exceeds the capacity of the reservoir and flows over the top of the dam, eroding it, or when water flows through the foundation beneath the dam, eroding it. If a dam failure were to occur, a wall of water would flood downstream areas, including many major roadways and highways that are considered evacuation routes. If the people downstream are unable to respond quickly and appropriately, they could be swept away by fast-moving water, which is forceful and deep enough to move vehicles within the flood area.\n\nWhen heavy rain occurs, Whittier Narrows Dam is designed to store excess rainfall runoff in the basin and then release the water to give swollen streams and rivers below the dam a chance to recede. Like all dams, Whittier Narrows Dam can only store so much water; the flood space is not infinite. Extreme weather can result in flood waters that can exceed the capacity of what the dam and basin are designed to retain. When this happens, water flows uncontrolled over the spillway to prevent a more destructive breach of the structure. When more water enters the basin than can be released from the dam, water could back up, exceed the basin\u2019s storage capacity and potentially result in flooding outside of the basin. Also, water could flow over the top of the dam, potentially resulting in a breach of the dam\u2019s earthen embankment, flooding downstream communities. These extreme weather events can potentially cause a significant threat to millions of people and billions of dollars in property damage, both downstream and upstream of the dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase the frequency of this monitoring during lake levels rises, earthquake events, or other signs of distress.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Design of a long-term solution to address the concerns identified through the most recent risk assessment are currently under design.  The USACE continues to inspect and monitor the dam while also evaluating potential interim risk reduction measures to reduce risk as low as possible until the design and construction are complete.",

    "projectDescription": "Atwood Lake is located on the Indian Fork of the Conotton Creek about 14 miles upstream of Dover Dam and 4 miles south of New Cumberland, Ohio. The lake was constructed primarily for flood control, recreation, fish, and wildlife management. The Atwood Dam is a rolled soil and rock fill with a clay core. The dam measures 65 feet high, 3,700 feet long, with a top width of 30 feet, and a base width of 360 feet. The project acts as part of a 14-reservoir system of dams designed to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding within the Muskingum River Basin in southeastern Ohio. Construction of the dam begin in August 1935 and was completed in September 1937.",
    "riskCharSummary": "A breach of Atwood Dam would cause significant flooding downstream in the cities of New Cumberland, New Philadelphia, New Comerstown, Coshocton and Zanesville. The primary failure risk associated with Atwood Dam is leak erosion along the left abutment of the dam. There may exist an open defect along the bedrock adjoining the left abutment of the dam which may allow water to pass during high pool levels. As water passes through the defect, erosion could progress and eventually cause an uncontrolled release of water. \n\nRegional impacts of a dam failure would be observed as far as Zanesville, Ohio. Critical infrastructure such as electrical substations, emergency management, transportation and airports would be significantly affected.  The Tuscarawas river at New Philadelphia would be almost a mile wide. Models show that the most significant damage would occur between 7 to 15 miles downstream of Atwood Dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Atwood Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Robustness of the dam is being improved with implementation of an Interim Risk Reduction Measures Plan (IRRMP) to address specific risk concerns while long-term remedial measures are pursued. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with USACE staff and local and state emergency responders.",

    "projectDescription": "The Holt Lock and Dam is located on the Black Warrior River.  The project includes a lock and dam at navigation mile 347.0 above the foot of Government Street, Mobile, Alabama.  The project was authorized under provisions of the River and Harbor Act approved March 3, 1909 which granted the Secretary of War (now Secretary of the Army) discretionary authority to reconstruct obsolete navigation structures, subject to consideration and approval by the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors and the Chief of Engineers.  The project replaced obsolete locks 13, 14, 15 and 16.  The project was completed in 1969.\n\nThe navigation lock provides a nominal chamber of 110 x 600 feet.  The lift is 64 feet, with a depth of 13 feet over the miter sills.  The gated spillway has fourteen 40-foot wide by 35-foot high gates. The 130-foot long non-overflow section has a powerhouse, constructed and operated by the Alabama Power Company.  The 18.5-mile long lake created by this dam has an area of 3,300 acres, a capacity of 117,990 acre-feet at normal pool elevation 187.1 feet North American Vertical Datum (NGVD), and a 9 x 200 foot navigation channel extending its entire length",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be very low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates have been for this dam since there is potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, flooding nearby could occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.   During a large flood, failure would result in flooding downstream.  Flood mapping has been developed to indicate potential flooding extents during a range of river conditions for both breach and non-breach scenarios.  These maps should be used by the public and state and local emergency managers for their awareness and preparedness in the event of a dam breach incident.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nAlthough Hop Brook Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Hop Brook Dam is designed to manage peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Hop Brook Dam through the ungated spillway during high water events. This type of water release occurs when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Water moving through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a four-story building. While weather can be unpredictable, this type of event can often be predicted 1-2 days before flood waters would impact downstream communities. USACE will engage state emergency managers when such an event is forecasted and support actions to get people to safety.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment in 2024 and classified the risks associated with the Hop Brook Dam as very low. This classification reflects the relatively low potential for life loss if there was a breach of Hop Brook Dam.   The risk is driven by the possibility of erosion in the embankment and by overtopping of either the dam or the dike.   In the case of an extremely rare and large rain event, water could potentially flow over the top of the dam, which could cause erosion of the earthen embankment, and breach of the dam. Or internal erosion of the embankment could create a flow path through the dam, which would eventually allow the crest to collapse.  In these scenarios,  Naugatuck and Ansonia, CT, along with smaller communities along the river, would be the most impacted.  Downstream flooding in Naugatuck would occur less than an hour after of breach and the rapidly moving water could be as deep as 17 feet, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nHop Brook Dam is operated in conjunction with Hancock Dam and the Stamford Hurricane Barrier, and is staffed full time.  During high pools, Hop Brook Dam is inspected on a daily basis.   When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Stillhouse Hollow Dam in 1968 in accordance with the Flood Control Act approved 3 September 1954 (Public Law 780, 83rd Congress, Second Session) and substantially in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief of Engineers contain in House Document No. 535 (81st Congress, 2nd Session), \u201cReport of Survey of Brazos River and Tributaries, Texas, Oyster Creek, Texas and Jones Creek, Texas.\u201d Stillhouse Hollow Dam, formerly known as Lampasas Dam, was built on the Lampasas River to reduce the risk of flooding to the downstream Texas cities of Belton, Little River/Academy, and adjacent towns and counties by holding back waters during heavy rain events until they can be released without damage to lives, property or the environment. Stillhouse Hollow Dam is located 5 miles southwest of the City of Belton in Bell County, Texas. The dam consists of an earthen embankment and dike that holds water in the reservoir, hydraulic slide gates that are operated to release water in a regulated manner during and after flood events, and an uncontrolled broadcrested weir spillway which holds water to 32\u2010feet below the top of the dam to allow water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir become high. The dam is made up of soil and rock and is approximately 200 feet high (approximately 20 stories) at a crest elevation of 698.24 feet (NAVD88 vertical datum control). The embankment is approximately 8,070 feet long, not including the spillway. The earthen dike, located south of the spillway, is 6,004 feet long and armored with riprap on the upstream slope. The reservoir is kept at or below the conservation pool elevation of 622.24 feet NAVD88 for most of the year. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir and released in accordance with the water control manual. Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam also provides water conservation, water supply, and unique recreation opportunities. These benefits significantly improve the quality of life in the surrounding communities.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Even though Stillhouse Hollow Dam reduces the risk of flooding to the downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. USACE Fort Worth District performed a Semi\u2010Quantitative Risk Assessment (SQRA) in January 2014 and completed a 2019 Phase 2 Issue Evaluation Study (IES). The Phase II IES was conducted to better define the risk characterization of the project and reduce uncertainties. Field investigations were conducted, including mapping of three faults, mapping of bedrock, and completing material sampling and testing from borings executed to install additional instrumentation. A thorough analysis of construction documents was conducted as a part of completing the Phase 2 IES. Re\u2010evaluation of the 2014 potential failure modes based on Phase 2 IES information resulted in classifying the risk associated with Stillhouse Hollow Dam to be low. The primary risks associated with the project are concentrated leak erosion and overtopping. In the remote event of a dam breach, the primary consequence centers of Belton, Little River\u2010Academy and Cameron, Texas, would see flood wave arrival times close to 1.5\u20103 hours following the breach. Bell County, TX accounts for over 70% of the total population at risk within 60 miles of the dam. Brazoria County, TX, which is 380 miles downstream near Freeport, TX, has the greatest population at risk of any county but flood wave arrival time is greater than 5 days. In any of these unlikely scenarios, downstream flood depths would be high and the main impact areas closer to the dam would reach 36 feet above streambank with 2 hours after breach, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. Although these communities have well practiced emergency action plans and local emergency managers meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, including the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To lower the risks associated with the dam, inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam. Surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Routine maintenance and dam safety monitoring are performed to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. USACE Fort Worth District regularly inspects and monitors instruments that help ensure that the structure is performing as intended and to help detect potential concerns. USACE recently added a left abutment seepage collection weir based on observations of past performance in this area and Phase 2 IES report recommendations. An automated data collection system was also added to measure spillway seepage flows at Chalk Ridge falls and select piezometers were installed during the 2017 IES investigations. A stockpile of emergency supply materials has been recently added along the right abutment of the dam. USACE Fort Worth District also works closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize time for evacuation and designating evacuation routes; annually update the Stillhouse Hollow Dam Emergency Action Plan; conduct emergency exercises with state and local response teams; and communicate risks associated with Stillhouse Hollow Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers.",

The dam is located on the Columbia River, near Bridgeport, Washington, approximately 545 miles above the river\u2019s mouth. The dam structure is primarily a concrete dam with earthen embankments on both abutments. Chief Joseph Dam is the second largest producer of hydropower in the US. Water stored by the project is also used for recreation and fish and wildlife conservation. Flood storage behind the project is minimal, and Chief Joseph Dam will typically pass whatever water Grand Coulee Dam (operated by Bureau of Reclamation) discharges. River flows are normally passed through the powerhouse to generate electricity, but a gated concrete spillway is also available to release excess flows during normal river operations and during extreme flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Chief Joseph Dam in August 2018 to determine potential threats to the ability of USACE to meet the operational management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low. One unlikely failure scenario analyzed involved a rotational failure of one or more spillway monoliths occurring either during normal operating conditions or because of an earthquake, resulting in potentially deadly flooding in Bridgeport, Brewster, Pateros and other downstream communities. Although this failure scenario is considered extremely unlikely, USACE maintains a Chief Joseph Dam Emergency Action Plan to lower the risk of life loss and property damage if this or other failure scenarios occurred.\n\nUSACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well-maintained, and will continue to perform as designed. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate flooding. Extreme snowmelt and rainfall events require USACE to release rising water through the dam\u2019s spillway to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam and to balance flood risk on the reservoir upstream. This can result in flooding areas downstream.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce risks to life safety and property, including enhanced monitoring and lifecycle maintenance. USACE conducts regular inspections and maintains a network of instruments to monitor the health of the dam. The frequency of inspections and instrumentation readings increases for unusual events to confirm whether the structure is performing as designed and identify areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Rainfall and snowpack forecasts are continuously monitored to determine when high river flow events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood operations and associated warnings. USACE also works closely with local emergency managers to annually update the Emergency Action Plan, conducts periodic emergency exercises with state and local response teams, and annually hosts water control information stakeholder meetings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Dashields Locks and Dam across the Ohio River in 1928.  The dam is located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, about 13 miles downstream of the head of the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Emsworth Locks and Dam, which is located Neville Township, Pennsylvania. The dam is concrete and has a fixed crest, which means that the river flows freely over it.  The locks provide a lift of 10 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The locks allow river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The locks are rectangular chambers that are 110 feet wide by 600 feet long (main chamber) and 56 feet wide by 360 feet long (auxiliary chamber).  The lock chambers are adjacent to each other and are formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  Dashields Locks and Dam provides economic benefits by enabling shipping of materials and goods, water supply (through municipal intakes in the upper pool) and providing recreational opportunities for metropolitan Pittsburgh.  The total benefits to the region are nearly 270 million dollars each year.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2016, which characterized the risk as very low. The assessment identified one primary, but very unlikely scenario that could cause the dam to fail.  If the riverbed downstream of the dam were to erode deeply, a portion of the concrete dam could slide downstream and release the water in the upper pool.  Although this scenario is very unlikely, it would most likely occur during a time of normal river levels.  If the upper pool is released, river navigation would be halted, and water supply intakes could be affected resulting in a loss of economic benefits to the region of about 270 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping, water supply, and boat recreation.  Although this scenario is possible, the dam has performed well for over 90 years without incident. Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure all steps are being taken to reduce the risk to the economy, we conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communications and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam\u2019s upper pool or may adversely affect navigation.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We also communicate with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and any changes to the lock operations. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the riverbed and the locks and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts and river levels to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "Fort Peck Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Operating since 1940, it was the first (and uppermost) of six projects built on the mainstem of the upper Missouri River which, in combination with dams on the river\u2019s tributaries, reduce the risk of downstream flooding along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, this \u201cmainstem\u201d system of dams is managed to balance hydropower generation, water supply, water quality, irrigation, fish and wildlife conservation, navigation, and recreation benefits.  \n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet structure for releasing stored water, two powerhouses, and gated spillway used to release excess water during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, USACE releases up to 15,000 cubic feet of water per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons) through the powerhouses to manage reservoir elevations and generate power. As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, water is released through two outlet tunnels which can release up to 45,000 cfs. When reservoir levels from extreme storms or snowmelt exceed the outlet structure\u2019s release capacity, additional releases are made using 16 spillway gates to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to additionally release up to 250,000 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release.\n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Fort Peck Dam as a result of flooding was 65,900 cfs from the powerhouse and spillway in 2011. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Fort Peck Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can the system of dams in which it operates). While unlikely, a non-breach release when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n\nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threats that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, are damage to the spillway during non-breach releases and erosion of the dam\u2019s foundation from water flowing beneath the embankment. Although these scenarios are extremely unlikely, failure of the dam or spillway would require historic water releases from the downstream Missouri River dams (Garrison, Oahe, Big Bend, Fort Randall, and Gavins Point) to preserve their structural integrity. In an extreme case, water from Fort Peck could exceed the storage capacities of these dams, leading to overtopping and \u201ccascading\u201d dam failures. Over the course of days to weeks, these flows would result in swift, deep, and life-threatening flooding in numerous communities (both with and without levees) along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities). \n\nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Fort Peck Dam as \u201chigh\u201d among its more than 700 dams due to the potential loss of life and large, national-scale consequences in the unlikely event that a breach occurs. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure. Please note that some scenarios in this database for the six USACE dams on the upper Missouri River do not depict the full extent of downstream inundation including the extent of \u201ccascading\u201d inundation that could develop from upstream Missouri River dam failure(s).

    "riskManagementMeasures": "Ongoing Actions:  The USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks. For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.\n\nActions at Fort Peck Dam:  While USACE continues to evaluate how to further reduce the risks associated with Fort Peck Dam, risk reduction actions were completed following flooding in 2011,  including installation of additional drains to further control water flowing through the dam\u2019s foundation and additional instrumentation to enhance foundation monitoring. Numerous repairs have also been made to the spillway to improve its resiliency during future flood events. \n\nBuilding Awareness:  Since dams do not eliminate flood risk, communities downstream of USACE\u2019s Missouri River dams are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to their family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.

    "projectDescription": "Mohawk Dam is one component of a system of flood risk management (FRM) projects located in the Muskingum River Basin in Ohio and was authorized and constructed through a cooperative agreement with the Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District (MWCD). The Flood Control Act of 1939 turned over ownership, as well as operations and maintenance, of the Muskingum Basin projects to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). This transition resulted in a partnership between USACE and the MWCD wherein USACE owns the dams and immediate land footprint of the dam, while the MWCD owns the land beneath the reservoir, stored waters, and surrounding lands. The Dam is located on the Walhonding River, 17.4 miles above the mouth of the Walhonding River and 129.8 miles above the mouth of the Muskingum River. Mohawk Dam also controls the outflow from four other USACE flood control dams located in the Mohawk drainage basin. The projects include Mohicanville Dam, Charles Mill Lake, Pleasant Hill Lake, and North Branch of Kokosing Lake. The floodplain between Mohawk Dam and downstream at-risk population centers is a gentle sloping valley. Development is relatively sparse comprised of small to moderate communities, several industrial sites, and farmland.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Mohawk Dam significantly reduce the risk of flooding to surrounding communities; however, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Although Mohawk Dam have historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam and levee operate as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event.  This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillways.  In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the project\u2019s construction. \n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Mohawk Dam in 2017  and classified the risk of failure for Mohawk Dam as low.  The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the spillways have the potential to pass over 151,000 cubic feet of water per second.  The operation of the spillway would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching. \n\nWhile the Mohawk Dam spillway has never flowed, if operated it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Coshocton, OH to the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio Rivers.  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, gas, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along the Scioto River, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows.  \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach high elevations quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Mohawk Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Mohawk Dam. The project is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam, levee, and dikes during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting tabletop exercises and dam safety training with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Proctor Dam in January 1964 as one of four flood risk management projects in cooperation with the Brazos River Authority. It is located approximately 8 miles northeast of the town of Comanche in Comanche County, Texas. The dam reduces the risk of downstream flooding along the Leon River by holding back waters during heavy rain events. The dam is an earthen dam, approximately 2.5 miles long, with a gated concrete spillway in the middle. The gated spillway is controlled by eleven tainter gates that hold water to 9 feet below the top of the dam to regulate water storage and releases. There are also two low-flow conduits in the center of the gated spillway for water supply releases. Additional benefits of the dam are recreation and fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Proctor Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Proctor Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. USACE completed a risk assessment in March 2019, and a modification study in April 2020, and classified the risks associated with the project as moderate. This classification is based on an extremely unlikely flood event which could cause water to flow through the dam\u2019s foundation and eventually weaken the dam. In the remote event of a dam breach, the largest impacts would be to the Cities of Belton and Temple, TX, located approximately 200 miles downstream of the dam. Downstream flooding of these Cities would occur within three days of breach, and could be as deep as a one-story structure, damaging or destroying buildings. The City of Sugarland, TX, located approximately 435 miles downstream of the dam, would also be impacted in the remote event of a dam breach. Downstream flooding in Sugarland would occur within 14 days of breach and be as deep as a one-story structure, damaging or destroying buildings and critical infrastructure such as schools, police and fire stations, and a hospital. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Proctor Dam through the gated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and the spillway gates are opened to allow excess water to flow through the spillway. Surcharge releases through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a one-story building. Although the large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans, and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To lower the risks associated with the dam, USACE conducted a Dam Safety Modification Study in April 2020 to evaluate alternatives to reduce risks. The primary alternative under consideration includes installing a filter trench collection system, to capture any water seeping through the dam and safely transport it away from the dam and increasing the thickness of the berm already installed at the toe of the dam. Once approved and funded, construction activities will begin with an estimated completion date in late 2024. USACE has also implemented a temporary change to the water control manual to make non-damaging releases from the gated spillway at lower lake elevations than previously approved to reduce the water pressure on the dam and reduce the amount of water seeping through the dam. This temporary change to the water control manual will be reevaluated once the dam modification construction is complete. Inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam. Surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Routine maintenance and dam safety monitoring are performed to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. The Emergency Action Plan is updated and exercised annually, improving emergency response and coordination between USACE elements and downstream federal, state, county, city agencies, and stakeholders. USACE also communicates risks associated with Proctor Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Table Rock Dam between 1952 and 1961. Table Rock Lake and Dam were constructed for the purpose of power generation and flood risk management. The project is a major unit in a comprehensive plan for the development of the water resources of the White River Basin in Missouri and Arkansas. The lake is one of a series of five lakes in the Upper White River Basin in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri. The USACE Little Rock District operates Table Rock along with Beaver, Bull Shoals, Norfork, Clearwater, and Greers Ferry Dams as a system of reservoirs to provide flood control, hydroelectric power, water supply, water quality control, recreation, fish and wildlife, and other benefits in the White River Basin. Storage is provided for flood control, hydroelectric power, municipal and industrial water supply. The permanent conservation pool also provides for recreation and wildlife habitat. To provide these benefits, Table Rock Dam impounds permanent inactive and conservation pools and a temporary flood storage pool. The dam consists of a rolled earth fill embankment, a controlled outlet works, and an auxiliary controlled spillway.\n\nTable Rock Dam, powerplant and spillway are located on the White River at river mile 528.8 in Stone and Taney Counties in Missouri. The dam is located approximately seven miles southwest of Branson, Missouri. The top of the dam serves as a portion of Missouri State Highway 165.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Table Rock Dam in December 2012 that categorizes the risk of the project as moderate, which is USACE\u2019s third highest risk category. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although Table Rock Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction. In the unlikely event of extreme flooding, an uncontrolled release of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding of Branson, Missouri, and other downstream communities. Table Rock Dam has an Emergency Action Plan and Risk Reduction Measures to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE performs ongoing inspection, maintenance, and monitoring activities to ensure the integrity of the Table Rock Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events. USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam. USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the LaGrange Lock and Dam in 1939 for the purpose of navigation.  LaGrange Lock and Dam is located on the Illinois River about 8 river miles southwest of the City of Beardstown, Illinois. The project consists of a lock chamber, a pool regulating dam Tainter gate, a wicket dam, an abandoned pool regulating structure, and an earthen embankment. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 10 feet, depending on the river conditions. The Tainter gate is used to control the water levels on the upstream pool and is 84 feet long. The 436 feet long wicket dam consists of 109 wooden panels that can be raised to hold a pool or lowered to create an open river depending on the river flows. When flows are high enough to maintain minimum navigation depths without the dam, the wickets are lowered to the riverbed and traffic can bypass the lock by travelling over the lowered wickets. When river flows are low enough to not allow minimum navigation depths without the dam, the wickets are raised to hold an upstream pool, which forces river traffic to pass through the lock chamber to continue up or down the river. The abandoned regulating structure was once used to regulate the upstream water levels but was replaced by the Tainter gate and abandoned in place. The earthen embankment connects the abandoned regulating structure to high ground and is 390 feet long. During flood events on the Illinois River, the wickets are lowered to the riverbed, the Tainter gate is raised above the predicted water levels, and the lock chamber goes under water. Once water levels recede, the site is cleaned and normal operation of the project features resume. The biggest flood on record was on July 2, 2015 and submerged the lock chamber by 14 feet and 2 inches of water.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in March 2022 and classified the risk associated with LaGrange Lock and Dam as very low. The risk assessment investigated the potential for ice damage to the wicket gate structures. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by LaGrange Lock and Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the lock and dam to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Hammond Dam in 1978 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on Crooked Creek in Tioga County, PA, immediately upstream of the borough of Tioga.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Hammond Lake which provides water quality and recreation benefits.  Hammond Lake and adjacent Tioga Lake are connected by a channel and the dams are operated together as a single Tioga-Hammond Project.  Flow from Hammond Lake primarily is discharged into Tioga Lake where it is then conveyed downstream through a conduit beneath Tioga Dam.  There is also a conduit which discharges flow beneath Hammond dam into Crooked Creek.  The project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Hammond Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to Crooked Creek which flows into the Tioga River.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Tioga, Lawrenceville, Corning, Elmira and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Tioga, Chemung and North Branch Susquehanna Rivers would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Hammond Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "Gavins Point Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Operating since 1955, it is the lower-most of six projects built on the mainstem of the upper Missouri River which, in combination with dams on the river\u2019s tributaries, reduce the risk of downstream flooding along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, this \u201cmainstem\u201d system of dams is managed to balance hydropower generation, water supply, water quality, irrigation, fish and wildlife conservation, navigation, and recreation benefits.  \n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, a powerhouse, and a gated spillway used to release excess water during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, USACE releases up to 36,000 cubic feet of water per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons) through the powerhouse to manage reservoir elevations and generate power. As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, additional releases are made through the 14 spillway gates to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to release an additional 584,000 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release.\n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Gavins Point Dam as a result of flooding was 160,700 cfs from the powerhouse and spillway in 2011. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Gavins Point Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can the system of dams in which it operates). While unlikely, a non-breach release when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n \nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threats that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, are erosion of the dam\u2019s foundation from water flowing beneath the embankment, damage to the spillway during non-breach releases, and powerhouse flooding leading to an inability to provide power to open the spillway gates. Although these scenarios are very unlikely, failure of the dam or spillway would result in catastrophic flooding with swift, deep, and life-threatening floodwater in numerous communities (both with and without levees) along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities).  \n\nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Gavins Point Dam as \u201cmoderate\u201d among its more than 700 dams due to the potential loss of life and large, national-scale consequences should abreach occur. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure.  Please note that some scenarios in this database for the six USACE dams on the upper Missouri River do not depict the full extent of downstream inundation including the extent of \u201ccascading\u201d inundation that could develop from upstream Missouri River dam failure(s). For more information on the USACE Dam Safety Program and risk assessments, visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Ongoing Actions: The USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks. For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.\n\nActions at Gavins Point Dam: While USACE continues to evaluate how to further reduce the risks associated with Gavins Point Dam, several risk reduction measures were completed, including the installation of additional drains to further control water flowing through the dam\u2019s foundation, additional instrumentation to enhance foundation monitoring, and construction of a large downstream filter to prevent erosion of the foundation soil. Numerous repairs have also been made to the spillway to improve its resiliency during future flood events and a portable generator is now available to provide back-up power to operate the spillway gates if the powerhouse floods. \n\nBuilding Awareness:  Since dams do not eliminate flood risk, communities downstream of USACE\u2019s Missouri River dams are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to their family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "Addicks Dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1948. The dam is approximately 17 miles west of downtown Houston, Texas, and stretches 11 miles across Langham Creek. Addicks Dam is operated in conjunction with Barker Dam, less than a mile away. Addicks Dam is to the north of Interstate 10 and Barker on the south of Interstate 10. Addicks and Barker dams both release into Buffalo Bayou and are in the same watershed. Together these dams reduce flood risk downstream along Buffalo Bayou and in significantly developed residential and economically critical commercial areas of Houston, including downtown. \n\nAddicks Dam consists of three main structural components:  a 48 -foot tall earthen embankment, the gated water control structure, and the emergency spillways. The embankment stores water runoff in the reservoir throughout the year. The water control structure consists of three gated outlets that can release a total of approximately 8,000 cubic feet of water each second; that looks like 3.5 million gallons of water passing every minute.\n\nDuring normal operations, USACE holds water behind the embankments of both Addicks and Barker dams and then releases water through the gated outlets in a controlled manner. USACE manages the capacity of the two reservoirs to remain within 20 percent of each other to help balance the total volume of water released downstream and ensures the downstream bayou below the dam can handle the additional releases from both dams. This coordination helps keep Buffalo Bayou within its banks; reduces threats to life safety and property downstream; and, reduces the potential of flooding to the communities surrounding the reservoirs when water levels exceed the capacity for which the reservoirs were designed. \n\nThe emergency spillways at both the Addicks and Barker dams consist of concrete slabs located at each end of the dams. These spillways pass high volumes of water during extreme rainfall events -- much like the overflow holes in a sink -- to keep water from overtopping the earthen embankment.  During extreme floods like Hurricane Harvey, USACE may release water through the outlets even though streams and rivers downstream may have already reached or exceeded their capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Addicks Dam significantly reduces - but does not eliminate - flood risks. Flooding can still occur in surrounding communities and watersheds. Large storm events may cause more runoff than Addicks Dam can store (the most recent example of this was during Hurricane Harvey in 2017). \n\nThe reservoir can store stormwater inflow within the boundaries of the government-owned land from what is referred to as a \"71-year flood\", which means there is a 1.4-percent chance of such an event happening every year. Although larger rain events like Hurricane Harvey are less likely to occur, damage can be catastrophic during these large floods. The greater stormwater inflow could inundate larger areas, leading to higher stages, or elevation, in the reservoir and areas above government-owned land. The upstream flooding may damage and destroy buildings, roads, and bridges, and could potentially result in the loss of life.  This starts to happen when pools reach an elevation of 103 feet North American Vertical Datum 88 (NAVD*), which is before water flows around or over the emergency spillway.  Water begins to flow around and over the emergency spillways when pools reach about 108 feet NAVD 88, with peak pool levels of 115 feet NAVD possible. Residents and property owners should check https://www.swg.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-Safety-Program/About-The-Reservoirs/Addicks-and-Barker-Potential-Flood-Maps/ and their home survey to evaluate their personal risk. Refer to the NID inundation maps here for additional details.\n\nIn 2013, and again in 2020, USACE completed risk assessments on the Addicks Dam to determine potential threats to its ability to reduce flood risks. Assessment results classified the risk as \"high\" based on the consequences of flooding to the large populations living and working downstream of the dam in the event of dam failure and upstream in the event of extreme floods. Although it is considered extremely unlikely, a failure of the Addicks Dam would include catastrophic flooding, widespread economic impacts and significant loss of life downstream.\n\nDam safety concerns identified in the 2013 risk assessment have been addressed by the construction of the new water control structure and cutoff wall completed in 2020.  The current risk at the dam is driven by the potential loss or movement of emergency spillway concrete slabs and breach of spillways at high-water elevations due to significant water pressures beneath the slabs. This increased water pressure could cause the slabs to pop up allowing water to more easily displace the slab and erode the soil beneath.\n\n*NAVD is the North American Vertical Datum. It is a point of reference on the earth used for measuring locations and elevations.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure Addicks and Barker dams can continue reducing flood risks, USACE operates the dams in accordance with a water control manual and consideration of current flow conditions, precipitation, and forecasts. USACE also coordinates operational decisions closely with the National Weather Service, Harris County Flood Control District, U.S. Geological Survey, and other agencies related to conditions both upstream and downstream of the dams. USACE updates the dams' Emergency Action Plans annually and practices emergency response efforts with state and local emergency management agencies and key stakeholders. Obtain additional information at https://www.swg.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-Safety-Program/ during extreme floods. \n\nUSACE recently constructed a new outlet structure to help reduce risks from foundation seepage and eliminate the instability of the original outlets at Addicks Dam. In addition, USACE continues to rehabilitate the concrete spillways by filling in cracks and joints to reduce their risk of failing at both dams. USACE  is currently undertaking the Buffalo Bayou Resiliency and Tributary Study to evaluate potential additional actions, including those at the Addicks Dam itself, to reduce flood risks upstream and downstream of Addicks and Barker dams. \n\nUSACE also regularly inspects the Addicks Dam and routinely re-assesses its risk. Dam safety professionals continuously monitor both the Addicks and Barker dams during high water events and are prepared to respond if performance issues arise during any event. In the case of an emergency, USACE will communicate with local and state emergency managers, in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan, to ensure the proper precautions are taken and that notification is provided to potentially impacted communities.",

    "projectDescription": "Green Peter Dam is located on the North Santiam River 7 miles upstream of Foster Dam and 10 miles upstream of Sweet Home, Oregon. Green Peter Dam is a 378 ft tall, 1,500 ft long concrete gravity dam with a concrete spillway, two spillway gates, two regulating outlets, and a powerhouse. Green Peter Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1963 and was completed in 1966. Green Peter Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, produce hydropower, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season. \n\nGreen Peter Dam is located about 80 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. USACE has been conducting advanced risk assessments, called Issue Evaluation Studies (IES), at several Willamette Valley Project dams including Green Peter Dam which was completed in 2020. The assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. As of result of the advanced study for Green Peter Dam, USACE identified the risk associated with the dam to be Low. The assessment considered five scenarios that could be damaging to the structure driven by an earthquake and two damaging scenarios driven by extreme flood events. For all the scenarios considered, the associated risks were found to be low and not to require any short-term measures or long-term modification. USACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded. Floods could occur in the future that may cause some inundation and flooding below Green Peter and Foster Dams in communities along the South Santiam River including areas of Sweet Home and Lebanon. \n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region.

    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE continues to evaluate the condition and risks associated with its dams and will continue to review the risk associated with Green Peter Dam in future routine studies. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Green Peter Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Green Peter Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Clarence J. Brown Dam in 1973. The dam is located on Buck Creek approximately 7.3 miles above its confluence with the Mad River. The project is located in west-central Ohio, 3.5 miles upstream of Springfield, Ohio, and 25 miles east of Dayton, Ohio. The dam project consists of a 6,620-foot long, earth-filled embankment having a maximum height of 72 feet, a gate-controlled outlet works, and a concrete lined chute spillway. The project reduces flood damages along approximately 7.3 miles of Buck Creek and approximately 26 miles of the Mad River, and to a much lesser extent the Great Miami River to its confluence with the Ohio River. The drainage area of the project is approximately 82 square miles. The record pool occurred in January 2005 and reached an EL. 1015 ft NAVD88. The dam has not experienced a spillway flow event.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of CJ Brown Dam in 2025 that classified the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 3 which is considered Moderate relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities however, it does not eliminate the risk completely. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to result in unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway. There is also an unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is spillway flows destabilizing the concrete lining of the spillway leading to loss of the concrete floor and deepening of the spillway channel. Another very unlikely scenario, is internal erosion of foundation material at the right abutment during a period of high reservoir levels. In these scenarios, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along Buck Creek and the Mad River.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream communities. The largest impacts include the city of Springfield, Ohio and the Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Huffman Dam, operated by a local municipality, would prevent flood waters from reaching Dayton, Ohio. In Springfield critical infrastructure that could be impacted by flood waters includes wastewater treatment plants, fire stations, police stations, schools, and electrical substations.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather Service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Rough River Dam in 1963. The Rough River Lake project is located in south-central Kentucky, approximately 60 miles southwest of Louisville, Kentucky, and 20 miles northwest of Leitchfield, Kentucky. The project consists of a 1,590-foot-long earth-filled embankment with a maximum height of 130 feet, a gate-controlled outlet works along the base of the right abutment, and a 65-foot wide, uncontrolled open-cut spillway through the left abutment. The project reduces flood damages along approximately 89 miles of the Rough River, approximately 71 miles on the Green River, and to a lesser extent on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The project has a drainage area of approximately 454 square miles. At spillway crest (EL. 523.57 ft-NAVD88), the reservoir extends up the Rough River\napproximately 45 miles. The record pool occurred in May of 2011 where the pool elevation reached 526.88 ft-NAVD88 and resulted in discharge from the spillway and high releases from the dam\u2019s outlet. During the record pool, peak depth for spillway flows was approximately 3.3 feet.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Rough River Dam in February 2023 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 2 which is considered High relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. This classification is based on the existing conditions and the potential for flood impacts to downstream communities. Although very unlikely, the primary risks to the integrity of the dam are: (1) Internal erosion of the dam\u2019s earthen embankment during a period of high reservoir levels and (2) A large flood event that exceeds the capacity of the dam to store water and water flows over the top of the dam even with maximum possible releases being made through the gates. These unlikely events could cause an uncontrolled surge of water to flow out of the reservoir and lead to breach. This would result in catastrophic flooding downstream, widespread economic impacts, and significant loss of life.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream communities. The largest impacts would be to Falls of Rough, Kentucky. Although consequences are generally concentrated in Falls of Rough, flooding would also impact several other small, rural towns located adjacent to the river, such as Dundee, Hartford, and Livermore, Kentucky. As reservoir levels rise, upstream areas will also be impacted. Impacts include flooding of local roads such as access roads to surrounding camp and visitor areas as well as flooding on State Routes 79, 110, 259 and many county roads.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To help mitigate risks associated with Rough River, USACE is implementing a Dam Safety Modification Project. Phase I of remedial construction which included foundation grouting of defects in the limestone bedrock was completed in May 2017. This was accomplished from the crest of the dam with re-routing of State Hwy 79 to an upstream bench. Phase 2 is currently under design and will include a full depth concrete cut-off wall along the crest of the dam and a new outlet works through the left abutment.\n\nUSACE is continuously taking significant steps on a day-to-day basis to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather Service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential  concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity.

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Marion Dam River Dam in 1968 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities as well as water quality, water supply, fish and wildlife, and recreation.  Marion Dam is located in east central Kansas approximately 5 miles northwest of the town of Marion, Kansas, on the Cottonwood River, a tributary of the Grand (Neosho) River.   The dam consists of an earth-fill embankment, an earthen dike connecting to U.S. Highway 56, an earthen dike on the west side of U.S. Highway 56, and a concrete gated spillway.   During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  This stored water can then be released from the gated spillway in a more controlled manner to reduce dangerous flooding downstream.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Marion Dam in 2025, and classified the risk associated with the dam as low. The risk is driven primarily by 1.) the potential for water flowing through the foundation sands beneath the dam to lead to erosion and breach and 2.) the potential for failure of the anchorage that holds the gates in place leading to uncontrolled release and loss of reservoir.  Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream resulting in loss of life and economic impacts. In the remote event of a dam failure, the towns of Marion, Florence, Cedar Point, Elmdale, and Strong City would be impacted. The levees in Marion and Florence would be overtopped for a breach from maximum pool. Portions of Cedar Point and Strong City would be inundated for breaches from top of flood pool and from maximum pool, while Elmdale would be completely inundated for both breach scenarios.\n\nThere are also risks associated with planned releases due to a large flood inflow. Spillway releases would not overtop downstream levees. The maximum non-breach release would inundate Cedar Point, Elmdale, and Strong City. There would be significant warning of a large flood of this magnitude, but life loss would still be possible given the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts to help manage the risk that Marion Dam poses to downstream communities. These include conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "Thomas J. (T.J.) O\u2019Brien Lock and Controlling Works is a navigation project located 326.0 miles above the confluence of the Illinois River with the Mississippi River at Grafton, Illinois. It is approximately 35 miles upstream of the Lockport Lock and Dam.  T.J. O\u2019Brien is located at the entrance to Lake Michigan in Chicago and is part of the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS).  The project is composed of a navigational lock, fixed dam, and controlling works.  USACE operates and maintains the navigational lock and fixed dam portions to allow passage between the CAWS and Lake Michigan, while the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) operates and maintains the controlling works to keep the water level on the riverside at -2.0 feet Chicago City Datum (CCD).   T.J. O'Brien is a low-lift sector gate lock and the lift varies from 0 to 5 feet from the Calumet River to Lake Michigan, depending on the lake level. The lock chamber is 1,000 feet long by 110 feet wide with two pairs of sector gates at both the river and lake ends; each of the gates weighs 216 tons.  Earth embankment dams extend approximately 2,000 feet east and 1,500 feet west of the lock.  The controlling works consist of four vertical slide gates (10 feet square) located near the center of the dam to regulate water flow. T.J. O\u2019Brien Lock and Controlling Works controls the movement of water between Lake Michigan and the Calumet River while maintaining navigation. The lock and dam are used for flood control and waterway flushing, and also function as components of the system used to regulate the Lake Michigan diversion.  Lake Michigan diversion involves accounting for withdrawals by the State of Illinois from the lake in accordance with the governing Supreme Court decree.  If flooding on the CAWS occurs, the MWRD will open the slide gates to allow water from the Calumet River to flow into Lake Michigan.  If the capacity of these sluice gates is insufficient, MWRD will instruct USACE to open the lock gates to increase the discharge capacity to minimize potential flooding on the CAWS .",
    "riskCharSummary": "There are two critical functions of the T.J. O'Brien Lock and Controlling Works. The primary function is to provide a navigation link between Lake Michigan and the Chicago Area Waterways (CAWS), which leads to the Illinois Waterway.  The other critical function is to allow backflow to Lake Michigan and reduce flood damages if flooding conditions on the Calumet River occur.  Also, the project provides protection from high lake levels in Lake Michigan from causing flooding downstream. Failure of the lock gates or structural failure of the lock would impact both navigation and the ability to release flood water.   If high lake levels occur, failure of the embankment dams to the east and west of the lock could result in downstream flooding.  Flood damages could result in inundation of over 3,000 structures in the area downstream in the southern part of the City of Chicago. Expected flood depths would be less than two feet.  If navigation was disrupted, potential economic damages of up to $10M (2017 estimate)  could occur if the lock was unable to be used for a 30-day period.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE staff are continuously on-site to operate and maintain the T.J. O'Brien Lock and Controlling Works.  USACE works closely with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) to manage water levels to minimize flooding.  USACE staff conduct regular inspections and monitoring of the project, with increased frequency during high water conditions.  The project has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that USACE coordinated with MWRD, the City of Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communication (OEMC), and the State of Illinois.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Truscott Brine Dam in 1982 with the primary environmental purpose of reducing the naturally occurring salt content in the Red River and storing it. Truscott Brine Dam is located on Bluff Creek, a tributary of the North Fork of the Wichita River, in Knox County, Texas, approximately three miles northwest of the town of Truscott, TX. Truscott Brine Lake Dam receives and retains brine (salt) water that is pumped from the Wichita River Basin via a Pump Station. There are no outlet works associated with Truscott Brine Lake. Water storage and releases are managed by an evaporation spray field and evaporation from the lake. There is a large, 1,000-foot wide ungated spillway to pass floods that exceed the capacity of the dam to store water.  Spillway discharge would pass into China Creek, a south bank tributary of the North Wichita River.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2019 and classified the risk associated with Truscott Brine Dam as low. This classification is based primarily on the very small populations living downstream of the dam that would be flooded in the event of a failure of the dam. Although unlikely, the primary risk to the integrity of the dam is the potential for Erosion of the spillway during a large flood event. An additional contributor to the project risk is the potential for water to seep through the foundation beneath the dam resulting in erosion and breach. Failure of the dam would include downstream flooding and widespread environmental impacts. In the remote event of a dam failure the largest life loss would occur around Lake Kemp 65 miles downstream. Additional impacts to the Lake Kemp water supply for Wichita Falls, TX and environmental impacts would be expected due to large amount of chlorides and sulfates in the water which could be detrimental to the wildlife, plants, and impact the ability to treat drinking water.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam. Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nAlthough Northfield Brook Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Northfield Brook Dam is designed to manage peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Northfield Brook Dam through the ungated spillway during high water events. This type of water release occurs when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Water moving through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as 13 feet. While weather can be unpredictable, this type of event can often be predicted 1-2 days before flood waters would impact downstream communities. USACE will engage state emergency managers when such an event is forecasted and support actions to get people to safety.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment in 2020 and classified the risks associated with the Northfield Brook Dam as low. There is uncertainty in the hydrologic loading on the dam that will be studied in the next risk assessment, which will be conducted in 2030 and will use evaluations that were completed for Thomaston Dam in 2023. Flooding would impact homes located along Northfield Road between the dam and Thomaston, Connecticut, which is the closest town.  Major flooding would occur in Thomaston were the dam to breach.  Flooding would also occur along the Naugatuck and its tributaries, including towns between Waterbury and Stratford, Connecticut. The unlikely, but more devastating scenarios that would produce significant downstream flooding is breach of the dam due to water flowing over the top of the dam. In the case of an extremely rare and large rain event, water could potentially flow over the top of the dam, which could cause erosion of the earthen embankment, and breach of the dam.  In these scenarios, rapidly moving water could be as deep as 13 feet in Thomaston, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nNorthfield Brook Dam is operated in conjunction with Thomaston Dam and Black Rock Dam, and is staffed full time.  During high pools, Hancock Brook Dam is inspected on a daily basis.   When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

The project includes a dam located on the Rio Grande in Sandoval County, New Mexico, immediately upstream of Pueblo de Cochiti and approximately 50 miles upstream from Albuquerque.  Construction was completed in 1975 and primary project features include a zoned earthen embankment dam; gated outlet works to adjust operational water releases into the Rio Grande; and spillway with concrete weir to pass much larger, uncontrolled flows during extreme events.  During flood events, the Cochiti Dam project can be operated for flood risk reduction on its own or in conjunction with other dams to optimize upstream and downstream flood risk reduction within the Rio Grande basin.  In addition to the project\u2019s main purpose of flood risk reduction, it is also authorized for irrigation and recreation benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquake or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included gate rehabilitation, repair and replacement of aging electrical and mechanical components, and routine vegetation removal.  Future risk communication activities include revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and development of a formal risk communication plan.  Flood warnings to notify affected communities downstream of the project are coordinated with external entities.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nThe potential for foundation seepage leading to failure of the dam is remote due to extensive foundation preparation and high quality bedrock. Also, the likelihood seepage and piping along the conduits is remote due to its embedment in bedrock on three sides. The dam and dike are normally dry and flood events are short in duration making the likelihood of internal erosion remote. Overtopping for the dam was considered remote because overtops the dam crest for less than 1.4 hours, the dam the downstream slope is erosion resistant. Overtopping for the dike was considered low risk because overtops the dike crest for less than 1.4 hours and the land side slope would incur some erosion, but likely not breach. Based on the results of the most recent Periodic Assessment, the likelihood of failure is expected to be remote for overtopping of the dam, remote for internal erosion near the left abutment, low for the overtopping of the dike with moderate incremental life loss for all.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nHancock Brook Dam is operated in conjunction with Hop Brook Dam, and is staffed full time.  During high pools, Hancock Brook Dam is inspected on a daily basis.   When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Fort Supply Dam in 1942 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities. The dam consists of an earthen embankment, a concrete gate tower with a conduit, and an ungated spillway. The project is located on Wolf Creek about 2 miles southeast of Fort Supply, OK; 3 miles north of the confluence with the North Canadian River. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream for communities along the North Canadian River.  This stored water can then be released in a more controlled manner to help reduce dangerous flooding.  These releases are initially regulated by the discharge conduit through the earthen dam. For larger flood events, releases are made over the ungated spillway.  The dam also provides local benefits including water supply for the cities of Fort Supply and Oklahoma City, water quality monitoring, fish and wildlife habitats, and recreation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2018 and classified the risk associated with Fort Supply Dam as moderate. The risk is primarily driven by the potential for water to flow over the embankment crest during an extreme storm resulting in embankment erosion and breach.  Another item that contributed to the overall risk is the potential for water seeping through the soil foundation to lead to erosion and breach.  In the remote event of a dam failure, the largest impacts would be to the cities of Fort Supply, Woodward, Seiling, Canton, El Reno, Oklahoma City, and other communities along the North Canadian River.\n\nA more likely flooding scenario includes the potential for water to flow over the spillway as intended during a large flood.  Although this flooding would be less significant than if the dam were to fail lifeloss and economic impacts could still occur due to the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk that is posed to downstream communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the EAP to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. These instruments are monitored regularly for any early indications of potential safety concerns at the project.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Carlyle Dam in 1966. The dam is located near Carlyle, Illinois, approximately 107 miles above the mouth of the Kaskaskia River. Carlyle Dam reduces the risk of flooding to Clinton, Fayette, Bond, and Marion Counties in Illinois by holding back water during major flood events. In addition to reducing flooding downstream, the water held back by the dam forms a reservoir called Carlyle Lake, which is the largest man-made lake in Illinois. Although flood risk management is the project's primary focus, the dam also provides water supply to nearby communities, recreation, and fish and wildlife conservation. It also releases water to support navigation flows downstream on the Kaskaskia River. The dam structure is primarily an earthen embankment with a gated concrete spillway in the middle, which is used to release water downstream to the Kaskaskia River. In addition to the dam, other structures related to the flood risk management project include the Keyesport Levee (which reduces flood risk to Keyesport, Illinois), Saddle Dam 2, and Saddle Dam 3 (which reduces flood risk to Huey, Illinois).",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Carlyle Dam in 2020 that characterizes the risk of the project as Very Low, which is USACE's lowest risk category. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although the Carlyle Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall and earthquake events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates.  In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam's construction.  A less likely scenario would be if one of the gates were to have a problem during operation.  In this case, more water than intended could be released, but that additional discharge would be limited to the amount that could pass through one gate.  The most devastating potential scenario, but significantly less likely to happen, would occur if the dam were subjected to a large earthquake while the lake level was already high. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding of Carlyle, IL, and other downstream communities. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, Carlyle Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  In addition, USACE holds annual Water Control and Dam Safety Information public meetings to discuss the risks with the public.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam.  The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Wister Dam in 1949 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities as well as water supply and navigation. The project also provides fish and wildlife habitats and recreation opportunities. Wister Dam is located on the Poteau River in Leflore County, OK, about 2 miles south of Wister, OK, 7 miles northwest of Heavener, OK, and 35 miles southwest of Fort Smith, AR. The features comprising the dam include a earthen embankment, a ungated spillway, gate controlled conduits that run through the earthen dam, and an earthen dike (Glendale Dike). During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream. Water releases are managed by the conduits running through the earthen dam for lower lake levels and over the ungated spillway for higher lake levels. Oklahoma State Highway 270 runs across the top of the dam and connects the town of Wister and the city of Heavener.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2022 and classified the risk associated with Wister Dam as moderate.  The risk is primarily driven by the potential for water to seep along the conduit in the earthen embankment eventually leading to erosion and breach.  In the unlikely event of dam failure, catastrophic flooding would occur downstream inundating numerous residential areas resulting in loss of life and widespread economic impacts. The most immediate impacted areas with major population centers would be the town of Wister and the city of Poteau.  Other impacted areas include Franklin, Crawford, and Sebastian Counties in Arkansas and Le Flore and Sequoyah Counties in Oklahoma.\n\nThere is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation which could include large releases through the ungated spillway during a flood.  Although the flooding would be less significant during this scenario compared to a dam breach, widespread economic impacts and life loss could still be possible due to the potential extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk Wister Dam poses to the community.  Based on the results of the last risk assessment, USACE will conduct a Dam Safety Modification Study to evaluate the need to modify the dam and reduce risk.  Additional actions include conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the EAP to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam. Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal reservoir levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. The dam also has a robust instrumentation program to monitor for changing conditions",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Beaver Dam in May 1965. Beaver Lake and Dam is a multiple-purpose power generation and flood risk management project and is a major unit in a comprehensive plan for development of the water resources of the White River Basin in Missouri and Arkansas. Beaver Dam impounds permanent inactive and conservation pools and a temporary flood storage pool to provide flood control, hydroelectric power, water supply, and other benefits in the White River basin. The project consists of a combination concrete gravity and embankment-type dam, a hydroelectric generating station, and three dikes in saddle areas.\n\nBeaver Dam and Lake are located in the White River Basin with a majority of the conservation pool in Benton and Carroll Counties, Arkansas. Beaver Dam is located on the White River at river mile 609.0 in Carroll County approximately six miles northwest of Eureka Springs in northwest Arkansas and approximately seventeen miles east of Rogers, Arkansas. The lake covers areas in Carroll, Benton, Madison and Washington Counties.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Beaver Dam in August of 2016 that characterizes the risk of the project as moderate. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although Beaver Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction. Beaver Dam has an Emergency Action Plan and Risk Reduction Plan in place to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE performs ongoing inspection, maintenance, and monitoring activities to ensure the integrity of Beaver Dam and to reduce risk to downstream communities. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events. USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam. USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Mud Mountain Dam in 1948. The dam is located on the White River, near Enumclaw, Washington, approximately 30 miles upstream of the confluence with the Puyallup River. Mud Mountain Dam\u2019s single purpose is to reduce downstream flood risk for Auburn, Pacific, Puyallup, and Tacoma by storing water during major flood events. The dam structure is an earthen embankment. A concrete outlet tower and outlet tunnel through bedrock are used to pass river flows during most conditions. A concrete spillway is also available to release large flows during extreme flood events. In addition to the dam, the White River/Puyallup levee system helps reduce flood risks.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Mud Mountain Dam in September 2019 to determine potential threats to the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low. The project\u2019s spillway has never been used, but in the unlikely event the concrete lining failed during spillway use, the underlying bedrock could erode, causing the dam\u2019s crest to be lowered, and an uncontrolled surge of reservoir water could be released. This would result in deadly flooding and economic damages in downstream communities. A second unlikely scenario involving overtopping of the dam during an extreme flood event would result in similar damage and downstream consequences. Although these failure scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, USACE maintains a Mud Mountain Dam Emergency Action Plan to lower the risk of life loss and property damage if any of these scenarios occurred.\n\nUSACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks and perform well during an earthquake. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate flooding. Extreme rainfall events could require USACE to release rising water through the dam\u2019s outlet tunnel and/or the spillway to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam. This extreme case could result in flooding areas downstream, and flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce risks to life safety and property, including major dam modifications. USACE conducts regular inspections and maintains a network of instruments to monitor the health of the dam. The frequency of inspections increases when conditions change to confirm whether the structure is performing as designed and identify areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Rainfall and snowpack forecasts are continuously monitored to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood operations and associated warnings. USACE also works closely with local emergency managers to annually update the Emergency Action Plan, conducts periodic emergency exercises with state and local response teams, and annually hosts water management meetings with stakeholders.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nThe previous risk drivers identified were internal erosion of the core material into natural foundation soils under the embankment. Since that evaluation, the availability of many years of data from multiple piezometers installed from 2008-2011 indicate that the dam cutoff is performing as designed and this internal erosion is no longer a risk driver. \n\nThe Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) does not overtop the embankment, but it will overtop at 140% of the PMF. Under this maximum loading it is possible that the spillway monoliths could be undermined.  The probability of this amount of water being held in the reservoir is about 1 in 31,900 years.  The incremental risk of the project is considered low.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nWestville Dam is staffed full time in conjunction with East Brimfield Dam and Conant Brook Dam by personnel trained in dam safety.  Project staff are in routine contact with downstream communities.  Instruments are reviewed monthly to look for changes in embankment behavior.  During high pools and as requested, the dam is visited by dam safety engineers.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed William H. Harsha Lake in 1978. The dam located on the East Fork of the Little Miami River, 21.3 miles above the junction with the Little Miami River near Terrace Park, Ohio. The project is located in southwestern Ohio about 25 miles east of Cincinnati, Ohio, approximately 7.0 miles upstream from Batavia and 3.5 miles east of Amelia, Ohio. The dam project consists of a 1,460-foot-long earth and rock filled embankment with a maximum height of 201 feet, a 2,622-foot-long saddle dam, a gate-controlled outlet works, an open cut spillway, and a dike constructed as part of the right spillway bank. The project reduces flood damages along 21.3 miles of the East Fork of the Little Miami River and along the main channel of the Little Miami River up to its confluence with the Ohio River. The drainage area of the dam is 342 square miles. The record pool occurred in May 2011 and reached elevation 776.85 ft NAVD88.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for William H. Harsha Lake in May 2016 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4 which is considered Low relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities however, it does not eliminate the risk completely. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to result in unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway. There is also an unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding which is internal erosion of the dam\u2019s or the saddle dam\u2019s embankment during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to breach of the dam. In these scenarios, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along the Little Miami River.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream communities. The largest impacts would be to the communities of Batavia, Milford, Newtown, and Cincinnati Ohio. Critical infrastructure that could be impacted by flood waters includes schools, fire stations, police stations, airports, and electric substations. Once flooding reaches the confluence of the Ohio and the Little Miami Rivers, flood waters would be primarily contained within the Ohio River. However, some areas along the Ohio River adjacent to the Little Miami River could be inundated.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast, and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather Service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Longview Dam, completing in 1985. Longview Dam is located at River Mile 42.9 on the Little Blue River, in Jackson County, Missouri. The dam was authorized for flood control, water supply, water quality control, recreation, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Longview Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $60.9 million (2018 price level) from 1984 to 2018. The dam is a rolled earthfill embankment approximately 1,900 feet long, the top of which is a maximum of 110 feet above the valley floor. Normal flows pass through an uncontrolled drop inlet and through a conduit underneath the dam.  Downstream communities include Kansas City, MO, Lee\u2019s Summit, MO, Independence, MO, Raytown, MO, and sections of Interstate Highways I-70 and I-470. The Longview Lake project includes one reservoir dike, Elm Avenue Dike, to fill a low spot in the reservoir rim west of the spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Longview Dam in July 2020 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low. USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate flooding. Extreme rainfall events could cause the reservoir to overflow through the spillway. The spillway discharges back into the Little Blue River and spillway flows may cause flooding in the downstream communities of Kansas City, MO, Lee\u2019s Summit, MO, Independence, MO. Erosion of the spillway during a flow event could lead to release of greater volumes of water.\n\nA far deadlier scenario is an extreme flooding event that leads to inflows into the lake greater than the storage capacity causing embankment overtopping. If overtopping occurs the earthen embankment portion of dam could erode leading to a sudden release of water downstream. This would result in the immediate release of water, and extreme, life-threatening flooding downstream of the dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will continue to work with communities downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Knightville Dam in 1941 across the main Branch of the Westfield River.  Knightville dam is operated by the Corps of Engineers for flood control with nearby Littleville Dam and to provide flood protection to downstream communities on the Westfield River.  It is operated in conjunction with 14 other Corps of Engineers flood control reservoirs in the Connecticut River basin, to reduce flooding on the main stem of the Connecticut River.  The dam was built in response to the severe flooding that used to occur in the Connecticut River basin.  Knightville dam normally does not hold water outside of flood events.  Since it began operations, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $350 million.\n\nThe dam is made of hydraulically placed and compacted earth fill with a layer of rockfill protection on its slopes.  The dam is approximately 16 stories (160 feet) high.  A 16-foot diameter concrete  lined tunnel in rock  passes through the dam.  Metal slide gates at the upstream side of this  tunnel are opened to allow water to pass through the dam and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the spillway, a sloped concrete structure located at the west end (right side) of the dam. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing.  The curved concrete spillway is slightly longer than a football field and is approximately two stories below the top of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Knightville Dam in 2018 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Moderate.  This classification is based primarily on the large population living downstream of the dam that could experience catastrophic flooding in the very unlikely event of a failure of the dam.  The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding in the downstream communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Knightville  Dam would be an uncontrolled high-volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also two extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would result in failure of the dam and downstream flooding:  (1) A flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded and/or the spillway is compromised or (2) water seeping through the earth embankment resulting in voids in the dam as the soil erodes, potentially weakening the dam.  Were either of these events to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  The towns of Knightville, Huntington, and Russell that are immediately downstream of the dam are the primary consequence centers.  Towns with larger populations that are further downstream such as Westfield, West Springfield, and Agawam in Hampshire County, MA experience some danger in the event of the flood.  Towns and cities including Hartford, New Britain, and New Haven, CT would also be impacted, but less so.\n\nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges.  In a worst-case scenario, you could see water varying up to the height of a two to eight story buildings.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists at Knightville Dam. Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we are taking actions to further reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of Knightville Dam and will modify operations if we feel there is risk to the public.  We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam.  We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner.  USACE is undertaking additional study to further understand the risk associated with Knightville Dam, and what, if any, actions can be completed to reduce the risk.",

Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Lawrenceville, Tioga, Corning, Elmira and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood. Other communities along the Tioga and Chemung Rivers would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Cowanesque Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Howard A Hanson Dam in 1962. The dam is located on the Green River, near Palmer, Washington, approximately 65 miles above the mouth of the Green/Duwamish River. Hanson Dam reduces downstream flood risk for Auburn, Kent, Renton, Tukwila, and Seattle by holding back water during flood events. Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary authorized purpose, the water held back by the dam forming Eagle Gorge Reservoir stores water for stream flow augmentation during the annual summer and early fall low flow period for fish and wildlife conservation benefits. The dam also supplies municipal and industrial water to the City of Tacoma and its partners. The dam structure is an earthen embankment with a concrete outlet tower and outlet tunnel through bedrock which is used to release water downstream to the Green River. A gated concrete spillway is also available to release large flows during rare flood events. In addition to the dam, the Green River levee system, which includes a series of federal and non-federal levees in the Kent-Auburn Valley, helps reduce downstream flood risks.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Hanson Dam in April 2022 to determine potential threats to the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as moderate, which is USACE\u2019s third highest risk category. One hypothesized failure scenario involves an extremely rare flood event overtopping the dam, resulting in erosion of the dam, breach, and an uncontrolled surge of water from the reservoir. This would result in potentially deadly flooding in Auburn, Kent, and other downstream communities. A second failure scenario involving erosion and collapse of the dam due to excessive seepage could lead to a similar, but even less likely result. Although these failure scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, USACE maintains a Hanson Dam Emergency Action Plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.\n\nUSACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam cannot eliminate flooding. Extreme rainfall events could require USACE to release water through the dam\u2019s outlet tunnel and/or the spillway to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam, resulting in downstream flooding that could resemble conditions experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce risks to life safety and property, including major dam repairs between 2009 and 2012. USACE intends further study of this dam to better characterize the recent risk assessment and will recommend and execute appropriate actions to reduce risks. \n\nUSACE conducts regular inspections and maintains a network of instruments to monitor the health of the dam. The frequency of inspections and instrumentation readings increases when the lake level rises to confirm whether the structure is performing as designed and to identify areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Precipitation forecasts are continuously monitored to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. USACE also works closely with local emergency managers to annually update the Emergency Action Plan, conducts emergency exercises with state and local response teams, and annually hosts water control information stakeholder meetings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Allegheny River Lock and Dam 7 across the Allegheny River in 1931.  The dam is located near Kittanning, Pennsylvania, about 46 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Allegheny River Lock and Dam 8, which is located near Templeton, Pennsylvania.  The dam consists of a concrete spillway section, which means that the river flows freely over it.  The lock provides a lift of 13 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream ends.  The upper pool of the dam provides recreation opportunities for surrounding communities. The dam provides about 300,000 in economic benefits to the region each year.  There are no means of controlling the flow over the dam and the dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam, which was performed in 2009, characterized the risk as low.  The assessment identified one primary scenario that could cause the dam to fail.  When the river is at normal levels, water seeping behind the lock wall could erode the soil behind the wall.  If unchecked, the erosion could progress to the point that the upper pool would be lost such that boats and barges would not have enough water depth to stay afloat. If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequence would be the loss of river traffic and recreation, which would damage the regional economy by approximately 300,000 dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping and boat recreation.  Although this scenario is possible, the project has performed well for over 90 years without incident or indications that this scenario is occurring.  Due to the relatively low height of the dam, which lies entirely within the banks of the Allegheny River, downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communication and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam or that may adversely affect economic benefits.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications.  We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Narrows Dam in 1950 and continues to own, operate, and maintain the structure today. Located on the Little Missouri River in Pike County, Arkansas\u2014about 6 miles north of Murfreesboro\u2014the dam serves two primary purposes: flood control and hydroelectric power generation. The dam stands 183 feet tall and spans 928 feet in length, with a concrete gravity design. It impounds Lake Greeson and manages runoff from a drainage area of 237 square miles.\n\nNarrows Dam contains five structural sections: east and west bulkhead sections, a spillway section, a flood control section with Howell-Bunger valves, and a power section equipped with three 8,500-kW generating units. Together, these features allow USACE to control flows for downstream flood risk reduction while supplying renewable energy. The dam is also a popular site for outdoor recreation, including boating, fishing, and camping.\nWater stored in Lake Greeson is managed year-round to balance flood control storage, conservation pool levels for hydropower, and recreational needs. The flood control section is used periodically for managed releases through two conduits, controlled by Howell-Bunger valves. The power section discharges water through penstocks into a tailrace, generating an average of 158 million kilowatt-hours per year, which is enough to power 28,000 homes per year.\n\nThe foundation of Narrows Dam rests on the Jackfork sandstone formation, a strong bedrock unit typical of the Ouachita Mountains. A grout curtain, foundation drains, and monolith drains were incorporated into the design to control seepage. Monitoring instrumentation, including piezometers and settlement markers, continues to provide data on the dam\u2019s performance.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Narrows Dam is currently classified as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4 structure, meaning it has low urgency but requires continued maintenance and monitoring due to aging infrastructure and identified deficiencies. While the dam has performed reliably for more than 70 years, risk assessments conducted by USACE identified potential vulnerabilities. The most significant life safety risk-driver is: Global instability of a monolith at an intermediate lift joint during extreme pool loading, potentially leading to dam breach and uncontrolled release of water downstream. Additional potential failure modes relate to economic impacts, such as: Trash rack guide failure due to corrosion, allowing debris into turbines and causing costly outages, and Tailrace scour undermining structural integrity of retaining walls.\n\nStructural cracking, undercut riprap downstream, leaking joints, and spalled concrete have all been documented in recent inspections. Some instruments used to monitor performance, such as piezometers and joint reference markers, are outdated or insufficient. While seepage and leakage are currently manageable, their persistence underscores the importance of annual drain maintenance and continued surveillance.\nThe likelihood of dam failure remains remote, but consequences of breach would be significant. A failure could result in downstream flooding along the Little Missouri River, threatening lives, homes, highways, and power infrastructure. Although such an event is unlikely, dam breach flooding would occur rapidly and with limited warning.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To manage the risks associated with Narrows Dam, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) employs a comprehensive dam safety program that includes routine inspections, periodic assessments, performance monitoring through instrumentation, and close coordination with emergency management personnel. Although Narrows Dam has performed reliably since its construction in 1950, its age, structural complexity, and importance for both flood control and hydropower production necessitate proactive risk reduction efforts to ensure long-term safety and performance.\n\nTo address the risks identified at Narrows Dam, USACE has completed several critical actions and developed a forward-looking plan to reduce dam safety risk. Recent efforts include the investigation of a newly discovered concrete spall beneath a powerhouse beam, which was determined to be superficial. In addition, the Howell-Bunger valves underwent non-destructive testing, and the flood control stilling basin was dewatered and thoroughly inspected.\nPlanned improvements include upgrades to the dam\u2019s instrumentation network. This involves installing reference markers on the spillway weir to monitor for structural movement and replacing degraded tubing in the piezometer system. Rising head tests will help verify the accuracy of these devices. These instrumentation enhancements will strengthen the dam\u2019s ability to detect early signs of stress, seepage, or structural displacement.\nStructural integrity will be further assessed through a detailed crack mapping effort and a finite element analysis (FEA) focused on the upper inspection gallery. This analysis will simulate the dam\u2019s behavior under varying conditions, including seismic loads, to evaluate the potential for monolith instability and recommend mitigation strategies where needed.\nHydraulic infrastructure maintenance also plays a key role in risk management. Planned work includes video inspection and cleaning of the trash racks and tunnels in the power section. Damaged or missing trash rack guides will be replaced to prevent debris-related turbine issues. Known joint leaks behind the powerhouse and within the monoliths will be grouted and sealed, while new surface drainage features will redirect runoff away from critical areas of the powerhouse\nFoundation performance is managed through flushing of the monolith and foundation drains. Seepage at known leakage points will be addressed with grout or joint filler, and all surface drains will be cleaned to minimize the risk of erosion. In the tailrace, specialized camera inspections will examine potential undercutting of grouted riprap, which could impact structural stability if left unaddressed.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Coralville Dam in June 1957 for the purpose of flood risk management, recreation, and fish and wildlife management.  Coralville Dam is located on the Iowa River about 4 miles north of Iowa City, Iowa. The earthen dam is over about a quarter mile long with a maximum height of 96 feet. Water can be released from the lake in two ways. The first is through the gated outlet structure, which consists of a gate tower, a 23-feet-diameter reinforced concrete conduit, and a stilling basin, which helps slow down water as it is released from the lake. The second is through an emergency spillway located on the west side of the dam. The spillway structure consists of a concrete barrier wall with a concrete lined chute and side walls. The spillway allows water to flow over the top of the barrier wall during extremely high lake levels. The spillway structure transitions into a natural ground spillway that empties into the Iowa River approximately a quarter mile downstream of the dam. Coralville Dam has prevented over $700 million in flood damages and protects more than 23,000 people living and working in the area below the dam. The highest lake elevation observed was in 2008 and was just over 5 feet higher than the crest of the emergency spillway. Water has reached the spillway only two times, in 1993 and 2008. The 2008 event released the record amount of water through the dam at 39,500 cubic feet per second, approximately 16% of the design capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in May 2014 and classified the risk associated with Coralville Dam as low. Water released from the dam could impact densely populated sections of Iowa City and Coralville, Iowa, to include the University of Iowa, with little warning time in the extremely unlikely event of a dam failure. The dam was found to be well-designed, well-constructed, and well-maintained and is expected to be reliable during major floods. However, there is a very remote risk of dam failure from a failure of the spillway slabs and training walls leading to erosion of the dam embankment. Although highly unlikely, a dam failure would produce a devastating flood with flood depths greater than 15 feet through downtown Iowa City and Coralville. The flood would inundate portions of Iowa City and Coralville along the Iowa River and the small towns and rural communities downstream along the Iowa River. Approximately 23,000 people live or work within the worst-case inundation area of the flooding caused by a dam failure.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Coralville Dam. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 response plan and evacuation procedures. Dam breach flood maps are available for public viewing on the National Inventory of Dams. USACE is developing a detailed communication plan based on the latest risk assessment findings and will engage in communication activities with state and local representatives, stakeholders, emergency managers, and the general public to increase awareness. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing lake levels. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal and high lake levels to ensure the integrity of the dam, identify deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. Lastly, the Iowa River Master Reservoir Regulation Manual, Water Control Manual for Coralville Lake is coordinated with upstream and downstream stakeholders, to allow the lake to be better managed in terms of earlier reservoir releases ahead of increasing lake levels in an effort to prevent emergency spillway releases.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Alvin R. Bush Dam in 1962 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on Kettle Creek in Clinton County, PA, approximately eight miles upstream of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River and fifteen miles upstream of Renovo, PA.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Kettle Creek Lake which provides recreation benefits. Releases are made by gates which discharge flow through a conduit in the abutment of the dam.  The project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Alvin R. Bush Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to Kettle Creek.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Renovo, North Bend and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the West Branch Susquehanna River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Alvin R. Bush Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Lock & Dam 8 in 1937.  The project is located on the Mississippi River near Genoa, Wisconsin. USACE operates Lock & Dam 8 primarily for navigation purposes, but congress also authorized USACE to make recreation improvements associated with the pool formed above the dam. Additionally, environmental management on the river is coordinated with the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources, and other state & federal agencies. The main components of the project include a lock, a gated spillway structure with 5 roller gates and 10 Tainter gates, two overflow weirs referred to as the Reno spillway and the Hastings spillway, and 2.9 miles of earthen embankments connecting these other components. The embankment sections are typically 19 feet high with a crest elevation of 638.8 feet (NAVD 88).",
    "riskCharSummary": "Lock & Dam 8 is a run-of-river dam that maintains a navigation pool for river traffic but does not store flood waters. The gated spillway is regulated to hold a constant pool level for navigation purposes at elevation 630.3 up to river flows of 95,000 cfs.  The 95,000 cfs flow has an annual chance of exceedance of about 50% each year.  Above this flow, the gates are fully opened, and the dam has less than one foot of impact on the river stages. The maximum water level differential across the dam is 11 feet and occurs at low river flows.  Based upon a risk assessment in 2019, USACE considers Lock & Dam 8 to be a very low risk dam among its more than 700 dams. Identified risks are primarily due to aging miter gates in the locks, and potential for navigation accidents.  Other risks include the failure of the earth dam due to overtopping or scour at the overflow spillways.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.   Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Other hazards exist, such as swimming and boat safety in the vicinity of the dam.  USACE regularly engages the public to raise awareness of the dam; and coordinates with state and county emergency managers (particularly during river flood events).",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of O.C. Fisher Dam in March 1951 as a response to historical flooding in the 1930\u2019s that resulted in millions of dollars in property damage to the City of San Angelo. It is located 2 miles west of the city of San Angelo in Tom Green County, Texas. The dam reduces the risk of downstream flooding along the North Concho River by holding back waters during heavy rain events. Currently, the reservoir remains dry most of the time due to the change in upstream vegetation as well as an increase in groundwater pumping. It only fills during heavy rains. The dam is an earthen dam, approximately seven miles long, with a concrete spillway that holds water to 25-feet below the top of the dam; however, there are no gates to regulate water flows when the reservoir rises above that level. Any water above that level will flow downstream. The dam also has gated concrete conduits, or pipes through the dam, for releasing additional water in a regulated manner during and after flood events. The conduits are not used during periods of drought. Additional benefits of the dam are recreation and fish and wildlife.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although O.C. Fisher Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. O.C. Fisher Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. USACE completed a risk assessment in May 2020 and classified the risks associated with the project as high. This classification is based on the large population that lives immediately downstream of the dam in San Angelo, Texas, as well as along the Concho and Colorado Rivers and their tributaries, including the cities of Austin and Bay City, Texas. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from O.C. Fisher Dam through the un-gated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Surcharge releases through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a one-story building. Two unlikely, but far more devastating, scenarios than presented above that would produce significant downstream flooding are breach of the dam due to overtopping of the dam and spillway erosion leading to breach. Although the lake does not typically hold water, in the case of an extremely rare but large rain event, the dam could potentially overtop, which could cause erosion of the embankment, and breach of the dam would be possible. In addition, large spillway flows could cause erosion in the channel downstream and potentially undermine the spillway control structure leading to a breach of the spillway structure. In either scenario, downstream flooding in San Angelo would occur within an hour of breach and could be as deep as a two-story structure, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. In either of these unlikely scenarios, failure of O.H. Ivie Reservoir (Simon Freese Dam, NID ID TX06386), located downstream of O.C. Fisher Dam, could also occur due to overtopping of the dam. Although the large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans, and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "In order to lower the risks associated with the dam, inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam. Surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Routine maintenance and dam safety monitoring are performed to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. Portions of the embankment crest road were repaired in 2019 to prevent water from seeping through the earthen embankment, causing voids as the soil erodes. The remainder of the crest road will be repaired as funds are available. The Emergency Action Plan is updated and exercised annually, improving emergency response and coordination between USACE elements and downstream federal, state, county, city agencies, and stakeholders. USACE also communicates risks associated with O.C. Fisher Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers. A study is planned for early 2022 to further analyze the dam risk and, in the process, develop a list of suggested ways to further reduce the risk posed by the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Lucky Peak Dam 11 miles upstream of the city of Boise in 1955 and continues to own and maintain the facility. The dam is built of compacted earth across the Boise River, is 250 feet tall and approximately 1,700 feet long (almost 1/3 mile). It includes a small compacted earth embankment (located at Barclay Bay) and a concrete auxiliary spillway.\n\nUSACE jointly operates Lucky Peak Dam, in coordination with the upstream Arrowrock and Anderson Ranch dams with the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the Boise Project Board of Control for multiple purposes. In the spring, as the snowpack melts, USACE and Reclamation manage water storage and its slow release from Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, and Lucky Peak to reduce downstream flood risks on the Boise River.  Water releases must be balanced before the summer months in order to provide adequate reservoir levels and flows for water supply, irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation for Boise, Idaho and the Treasure Valley. \nWater is typically released through one of two gated outlet tunnels in the dam or through the powerhouse which is connected to the main outlet tunnel. The combined outlets can release more than four times the amount the water that keeps the Boise River in its banks as it flows through the city. The auxiliary spillway on the dam's left (east) side is designed to pass high volumes of waters when it is necessary to keep water from spilling over the dam (overtopping). This can severely impact the integrity of the structure.  In the unlikely event that water exceeds storage levels, the spillway would pass this water over a concrete rim and down an earth and rock slope. This auxiliary spillway can release three times more water than outlet capacity - it has never been used.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Lucky Peak Dam greatly reduces flood risks downstream, it does not eliminate these risks. Flooding can still occur even as Lucky Peak Dam is operated as intended.  There are times, usually in the early spring, when USACE must release more water through the dam's outlets that exceeds the capacity of downstream river channels.  This results in localized flooding throughout the valley in areas adjacent to the river. These releases are made in balance to make room in the reservoir to safely store additional water and minimize the potential for catastrophic flooding that can hinder safe evacuation, endanger lives and result in significant property damage.  USACE communicates with local and state emergency managers when these conditions are anticipated. Emergency actions plans are activated in downstream communities and residents are instructed to heed all directives from emergency officials. \n\nWhile very rare, there is potential for storm events to cause more rainfall and/or snowmelt than Lucky Peak Dam can store safely. To manage this large amount of water, the full capacity of the outlets to release stored water may be needed, likely flooding downstream areas well above riverbanks.  As a last resort, the dam's auxiliary spillway can pass extreme volumes of water to keep the dam from overtopping. Overtopping the dam could result in 10 or more feet of water above the riverbanks. This water is likely to damage and destroy houses, buildings, roads, bridges, and power and water supplies. While weather can be unpredictable, these rare events can often be forecast 1-2 days before flooding begins to impact communities and USACE will communicates to local and state emergency managers if this could happen. In the unlikely event Lucky Peak Dam must pass this extreme volume of water, downstream residents should follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family's lives at risk.\n\nThe hazard potential for Lucky Peak is classified as \"HIGH\" due to the possibility of loss of life, property, lifelines, and environmental issues if the dam were to fail suddenly.  In 2020, USACE assessed Lucky Peak Dam for any concerns that might cause the dam to break during rare events. While the dam is well built and has performed exceptionally during its 70 years, USACE is conducting a follow-on study to investigate potential issues when impounding water that could contribute excess release of the pool. The dam's ability to withstand earthquakes is also being investigated further. In addition, extreme flows have not passed over the dam's auxiliary spillway so there is some uncertainty in the resulting conditions of the spillway during a rare extreme flow event.  The unlikely failure of the dam under one or a variety of circumstances could put tens of thousands of people in harm's way.    \n\nFull or partial inundation of USACE recreational facilities may lead to closures of recreation sites and hazardous boating due to floating debris.  Therefore, it is important to heed all directives to evacuate as communicated by USACE personnel and local law enforcement.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure USACE and Reclamation can continue to operate Lucky Peak Dam to minimize flood risks while balancing all its project functions, the agencies use the latest forecast, rain, snowpack, and stream gauge information available and monitor river conditions to help optimize operations of this dam and the upstream dams.  They coordinate closely with the National Weather Service, the U.S. Geologic Survey, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Snow Survey on conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam.  USACE continues to work with these agencies and local and state emergency management officials to prepare for emergencies.  This close coordination allows them to respond to events in a timely manner. \n\nUSACE maintains Lucky Peak Dam to ensure it continues to provide the benefits it has over the past 70 years. A routine risk assessment was completed in 2020 and a more thorough study is being planned to further investigate potential issues associated with dam and its auxiliary spillway. The dam is continuously monitored during high water events and following earthquakes by dam safety professionals, who are prepared to act if performance issues arise.  USACE addresses operations and maintenance issues associated with dam safety risks as they arise.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed the construction of Tom Jenkins Dam in 1968. Flood Control Act of 1938 authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the operation and maintenance of Tom Jenkins Dam.\n\nTom Jenkins Dam is a high hazard dam located in Athens County, Ohio, on the East Branch of Sunday Creek, a tributary of the Hocking River, approximately 3 miles upstream of Glouster, Ohio. Most dams that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages, if breached, would lead to loss of life and/or high economic impacts downstream causing them to be labeled \u201chigh hazard\u201d. The lake is a conservation pool for flood control, recreation, fish, and wildlife, and for water conservation.\n\nThe earthen dam has a length of 94 feet and a height of 84  feet and controls a drainage area of 32.8 square miles. The spillway is located approximately 1,000 feet south of the left abutment and consists of an uncontrolled partial concrete-lined saddle with a crest width of 80 feet. Operation of the spillway during extreme flood events could be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping. Between 1968 and 2022, the dam had prevented a total of $103 million of flood damages, which means it prevents over $1.9 million of flood damages per year.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Tom Jenkins Dam significantly reduce the risk of flooding to surrounding communities; however, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Although Tom Jenkins Dam have historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam and levee operate as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event.  This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillways.  In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the project\u2019s construction.\n \nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Tom Jenkins Dam in 2017  and classified the risk of failure for Tom Jenkins Dam as low.  The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the spillways have the potential to pass over 21,300 cubic feet of water per second.

Little Pond Dam is a small dam that retains a 5 acre-ft pool which is located in the project area north of the main embankment.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities; however, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Although Paint Creek Dam has historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event.  An event such as this could require unusually large quantities of water to be released. \n\nA 2019 semi-quantitative risk assessment for Paint Creek Dam classified the risk of failure for the entire project system as low.  The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the controlled spillway located approximately 1,000 feet from the right abutment of the dam has the potential to pass up to two-hundred fourteen thousand cubic feet of water per second.   The controlled spillway is designed to pass water to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.\n\nWhile the Paint Creek Dam spillway has never flowed.  If operated, it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from the dam to Bainbridge, OH.  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along Paint Creek, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows.  Although the odds of such a storm even occurring are considered extremely unlikely, Paint Creek Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any unanticipated scenarios were to occur.   \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach high elevations quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Paint Creek Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 22 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in July 1938 for the purpose of navigation. Lock and Dam 22 is located on the Mississippi River near Saverton, Missouri. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary miter gate bay, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section, a submersible earth dike, and a non-submersible earth dike. The main lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 10 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 3,084 feet and includes 1,024 feet of movable gate section, 1,600 feet of submersible earth dike, and 460 feet of non-submersible earthen dike. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in February 2018 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 22 as very low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from barge impacts to the spillway gates, spillway gate trunnion friction failure, a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock, and miter gate anchorage failure. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 22. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 21 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in February 1938 for the purpose of navigation. Lock and Dam 21 is located on the Mississippi River near Quincy, Illinois. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary miter gate bay, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section, a submersible earth dike, and a non-submersible earth dike. The main lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 10.5 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 2,960 feet and includes 1,066 feet of movable gate section, 1,400 feet of submersible earth dike, and 494 feet of non-submersible earthen dike. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in March 2018 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 21 as very low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from overtopping erosion of the submersible earth dike, a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock, and miter gate anchorage failure. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 21. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Conemaugh Dam across the Conemaugh River in 1953 to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in the low-lying communities on the lower Conemaugh Valley, the Kiskiminetas Valley, the lower Allegheny Valley, and the Upper Ohio Valley, including Saltsburg, Apollo, Vandergrift, Leechburg, Tarentum, the greater Pittsburgh area, and additional towns on the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.  The dam is located about eight miles upstream of Saltsburg, Pennsylvania and forms the Conemaugh River Lake.  Conemaugh Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $2.5 billion since the start of operations. The reservoir stores rainfall to maintain downstream flow within the downstream river banks and releases water after flood events; provides water to a hydropower facility; and provides numerous opportunities for recreation.  Conemaugh Dam is composed of both a concrete portion and an earthen (embankment) portion and has a maximum height of 157 feet and a length of about 1200 feet.  The concrete portion of the dam has spillway gates designed to release a large volume of water during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Conemaugh was completed in 2020, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as moderate urgency of action.  The dam was well-constructed and is well-maintained.  However, large populations live downstream of Conemaugh Dam, including those in Saltsburg, Apollo, Vandergrift, Leechburg, Tarentum, the greater Pittsburgh Area, and other low-lying communities on the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers. Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding to these communities, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from Conemaugh Dam would be a high-volume release over the dam\u2019s spillway (which has never been operated at full capacity since the project was put into full operation in 1953) during an unusually large and intense storm event.  Water released over the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam had not been constructed.  \n\nA less likely, but far more devastating flooding scenario exists: an extreme rainfall event that results in water flowing over the earthen embankment portion of the dam, eroding the embankment, and leading to a breach.  Although such a precipitation event leading to a breach is extremely rare, it is a possibility.\n\nIn either scenario, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Communities, including Saltsburg, that are closer to the dam, are in more immediate danger of a significant flood event and may have little advanced warning.  Cities and communities further downstream of the dam, such as Apollo, Vandergrift, Leechburg, Tarentum, communities in metropolitan Pittsburgh, and communities on the Ohio River have larger populations and possibly less awareness of the dam but will have more warning. \n\nWith either of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, possibly overflowing banks on the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers; the Tarentum floodwall;  the Braeburn Dike (near Tarentum); and the Wellsburg, WV levee, destroying buildings and infrastructure.  Anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plans. We will study whether there are additional measures that we can take to reduce the risk associated with high reservoir levels overflowing onto the earthen portion of the dam.  We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently during high-water events.  Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high-water event is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses.  We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current and forecasted lake levels at Pittsburgh District reservoirs are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttps://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Portals/72/docs/WaterManagement/ResSumPlots.pdf.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed the Mississippi River Lock & Dam 3 in 1938.  The project is located on the Mississippi River near Red Wing, Minnesota. USACE operates Lock & Dam 3 primarily for navigation purposes, but congress also authorized USACE to make recreation improvements associated with the pool formed above the dam. Additionally, environmental management on the river is coordinated with the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources, and other state & federal agencies. The main components of the project include a lock, a gated spillway structure with 4 roller gates, an earth embankment on the Minnesota side, and a series of overflow earthen embankments on the Wisconsin side.\n\nMississippi River Lock & Dam 3 is a run-of-river dam that maintains a navigation pool for river traffic but does not store flood waters. The gated spillway is regulated to hold a constant pool level for navigation purposes at elevation 674.6 (NAVD 88) up to river flows of 36,000 cfs.  The 36,000 cfs is exceeded about 15% of the time and occurs most years (typically in the spring).  Above this flow, the gates are fully opened, and the dam has less than one foot of impact on the river stages. The maximum water level differential across the dam is 8 feet and occurs at low river flows.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE conducted a risk assessment in 2021 and considers Mississippi River Lock & Dam 3 to be a very low risk dam (DSAC 5) among its more than 700 dams.  Lock 3 does have back tows that change with flow conditions and are dangerous to boaters and fisherman, so the public is reminded to obey the restricted zones.  Lock 3 was also known in the navigation industry to have strong outdraft currents that pulled barges into the spillway.  This has been mitigated by navigation improvements that included extension of the upper guidewall and moving the approach channel toward the spillway to reduce channel velocities in the lock approach area.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.   Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Other hazards exist, such as swimming and boat safety in the vicinity of the dam.  USACE regularly engages the public to raise awareness of the dam; and coordinates with state and county emergency managers (particularly during river flood events).",

    "projectDescription": "Chatfield Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Operating since 1975, it is the second of three \u201ctri-lakes\u201d dams built by USACE to collectively reduce risks from flooding in the Denver metropolitan area. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, USACE manages water releases from the tri-lakes system for recreation, water quality, and to support fish and wildlife.\n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet structure for releasing stored water, and a spillway over which  excess water can flow during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, the outlet structure provides water to downstream users and releases are generally less than 500 cubic feet per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons). As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, the outlet structure is used to manage the reservoir elevation and can release up to 8,400 cfs. When reservoir levels from extreme storms or snowmelt exceed the outlet structure\u2019s release capacity, water can flow through the spillway to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to additionally release up to 184,000 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release. The reservoir has never been high enough for spillway flow. \n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Chatfield Dam as a result of flooding was approximately 3,350 cfs from the outlet structure in 1995. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Chatfield Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can the system of dams in which it operates). While unlikely, a non-breach release when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n\nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threats that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, are overtopping and damage to the spillway during non-breach releases. Although these scenarios are very unlikely, failure of the dam or spillway would result in catastrophic flooding with swift, deep, and life-threatening floodwaters in many parts of the Denver metropolitan area and communities along the South Platte River. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities).   \n  \nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Chatfield Dam as \u201chigh\u201d among its more than 700 dams due\u2013should a breach occur-to the consequences to the highly urbanized downstream communities where the population has significantly increased since the dam was built. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure. For more information on the USACE Dam Safety Program and risk assessments, visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Ongoing Actions: The USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks. For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.\n\nActions at Chatfield Dam:  While USACE continues to evaluate how to further reduce the risks associated with Chatfield Dam, several risk reduction measures were completed including repairs to key spillway features to improve performance and improvements to runoff forecast models in coordination with the National Weather Service to accelerate public warnings from local emergency management agencies.  \n\nBuilding Awareness:  Since dams do not eliminate flood risk, communities downstream of Denver-area dams are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to their family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Allegheny 5 Lock and Dam in 1927 across the Allegheny River.  The dam is located in Armstrong County Pennsylvania, about 30 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, PA. The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam to Allegheny 6 Lock and Dam, which is near located near Freeport, PA. The dam consists of a concrete spillway section, which means that the river flows freely over it.  The lock provides a lift of about 12 feet, which is the height of the river level upstream of the dam (upper pool) to the river level downstream of the dam (lower pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream and downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The economic benefits of shipping materials and goods through the lock is more than 1 million dollars annually.  The pool created by the dam provides recreation opportunities for surrounding communities.  The dam also provides hydropower benefits of near 1 million dollars annually, as a private hydropower facility is located on the left bank in line with the dam. There are no means of controlling the flow over the dam and the dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2021, which characterized the risk as very low, because there is no potential for life loss or significant economic damages in the unlikely event that the dam was to fail. Although the dam holds back water, a dam failure at Allegheny 5 Lock and Dam will not result in the flooding of downstream communities.  \n\nIf the pool upstream of the dam is released due to a dam failure, river navigation would be halted, resulting in a loss of economic benefits to the region of more than 2 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping, hydropower generation, and boat recreation.  Although this scenario is possible, the dam has performed well for over 90 years without incident.  Due to the relatively short height of the dam, which lies entirely within the banks of the Allegheny River, downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public and the economy, we will conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communications and reactions in the event navigation is lost.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We will also communicate with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and any changes to lock operations. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the riverbed, lock, and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts and river levels to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Jennings Randolph Dam in 1981 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on the North Branch Potomac River on the state line between Garrett County, MD and Mineral County, WV, approximately eight miles upstream of the confluence with the Savage River at Bloomington, MD.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Jennings Randolph Lake which provides water quality, water supply and recreation benefits.  Releases are made by a system of gates which discharge flow through a conduit in the abutment of the dam.  The project also includes a gated concrete spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Jennings Randolph Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to the North Branch Potomac River.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam, and leading to a breach of the dam, or;  unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam eroding soil from within the embankment leading to a breach.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Bloomington, Luke, Westernport, Piedmont, Keyser, Cumberland and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the North Branch Potomac River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of the Jennings Randolph Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Braddock Locks and Dam in 1906 across the Monongahela River at Braddock, Pennsylvania.  At that time, The dam consisted of a concrete spillway section, which means that the river flows freely over it. The facility\u2019s two locks allow river traffic to travel upstream and downstream of the dam.  In 1953, the lock chambers were rehabilitated  and enlarged.  In 2004, a gated dam was constructed to replace the original dam.  The dam is composed of concrete with two overflow spillway sections and four steel gates which allow the river to flow.  The locks provide a lift of nearly 14 feet from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool), which extends upstream approximately 30 miles to the John P. Murtha (formerly Charleroi) Lock and Dam in Charleroi, Pennsylvania. The locks consist of rectangular chambers formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream ends.  The main lock chamber is 110 feet wide by 720 feet long and the auxiliary lock chamber is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long.  The pool created by the dam also provides water supply and recreational opportunities for the greater Pittsburgh region.  The economic benefit of shipping materials and goods through the lock, water supply, and recreation is more than 430 million dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment was performed in 2023, which characterized the risk as very low. The assessment identified one primary scenario that could cause the dam to fail. During periods of river flooding, a runaway barge could become trapped on the dam which could prevent one or more dam gates from closing. This scenario, although very unlikely could result in a loss of the upper pool to the extent that river traffic would be halted.  If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequences would be the loss of shipping, water supply, and recreation, which would damage the regional economy by about 430 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping, water supply, and recreation.  Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the J. Edward Roush Dam in 1967 across the Wabash River near the City of Huntington, Indiana as the eastern most of 3 dams to reduce the risk of flooding downstream on the northern portion of the Wabash River.  USACE Chicago District operates and maintains the dam.  The reservoir stores snow melt and rainfall runoff from late winter through early summer.  Periodic releases of water from the reservoir occur throughout the year to maintain seasonally specified pool levels.  Additionally, the reservoir provides recreational opportunities both in the lake and downstream.  The dam structure is primarily an earthen embankment with a concrete center portion that contains 6 sluice gates and 3 tainter gates.  The dam is approximately 6,500 feet long and 90 feet at the tallest point.  Upstream of the dam are two embankments, Markle and Star of Hope, that protect areas that would have otherwise flood by the reservoir created by the dam.  Normal discharges are through outlet works consisting of the 6 sluice gates in the center of the dam.  Before the reservoir exceeds capacity, the 3 large tainter gates will be opened to control water levels within the reservoir.  In the dam's more than 50-year history, these large gates have not been opened during a flood event.  The pool of record at the dam occurred in July 2003 and nearly reached that same level in July 2015. The dam performed well during each of these high water events without any problems.  To date, the dam has reduced downstream flood damages by more than an estimated $425 million.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The J.E. Roush Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, however, the dam does not eliminate this potential flood risk.  Downstream of the dam are the Cities of Huntington, Andrews, Lagro, Wabash, Peru, Logansport, Delphi, Lafayette, and Terre Haute, Indiana along with numerous other small towns and communities along the Wabash River all the way to the Ohio River.  The most likely scenario for downstream flooding from the J.E. Roush Dam would be a high-volume release of water from the dam's gated spillway during major high water events.  When the water level in the reservoir gets above a set elevation, the spillway gates will be opened releasing water to the Wabash River downstream to relieve pressure on the dam and to avoid the potential of water flowing over the top of the dam.  The amount of water released could be great enough to cause flooding downstream.  Higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam did not exist as the amount of water released would be controlled to match the amount of water coming into the reservoir.  These releases could impact travel on State Route 5 (Warren Road), North Etna Road, State Route 9 (North Marion Road), and US 24 (Wabash Road) downstream of the dam.  In addition, as the reservoir level increases, flooding will also be occurring upstream of the dam as the pool enlarges and extends nearly to the City of Bluffton, Indiana, about 16 miles to the southeast of the dam and could impact some local roads.\n\nThere are also two unlikely, but more devastating scenarios, that could result in significant flooding:  1) erosion of the soil foundation under the dam during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach; or 2) an extreme rainfall event that could result in water flowing over the top of the earthen embankment of the dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach.  In either scenario, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  The communities of Huntington and Andrews and other residences and businesses located in the valley below the dam would be in immediate danger if this were to occur.  Cities further downstream, including Wabash, Peru, Logansport, and Lafayette would also see large damaging flood conditions, but would have more warning time to respond.  In the two scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overtopping levees, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and unable to evacuate could perish.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several steps to reduce the risk to the public.  USACE staff are continuously on-site to operate and maintain the dam.  USACE works closely with state and local emergency managers, regularly conducts emergency exercises, and routinely updates the emergency action plan (EAP) for the dam.  USACE also conducts rigorous inspection, monitoring, and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur and provide information for any necessary flood warnings.  USACE continues to work with local communities to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Elk City Dam and Levee in 1966 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in Elk City and downstream communities as well as water supply, water quality, recreation, and fish and wildlife.  Elk City Dam is located on the Elk River, a tributary of the Verdigris River on the northwest edge of Independence, Kansas.  Elk City Dam consists of an earth-fill embankment, an intake and conduit for routine releases with a water supply pipe, an earthen dike, and a separate ungated auxiliary spillway.  Associated with the dam is Elk City Levee which is a combination of 3 levee sections protecting the city of Elk City from the backwater of Elk City Lake.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in February 2016 and classified the risk of Elk City Dam as low. This classification is based both on the low probability of failure and the low population at risk downstream.  The primary risk of failure is erosion along the conduit that passes through the earthen dam.  This would be a slow-to-develop failure.  If failure occurred during a rare high pool event, flooding in Independence and Coffeyville, Kansas as well as rural areas along the Elk River and the Verdigris River resulting in loss of life and downstream economic impacts.  \nThere are also flood risks associated with normal operation of the dam due to releases from the ungated spillway during a large flood.  There would be advanced warning of a large flood of this magnitude, but life loss is would still be possible given the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Elk City Dam poses to communities.  Along with routine inspections and surveys additional efforts include establishing emergency rock and sand stockpiles, emergency exercises, annual updates to the Emergency Action Plan, and development of a communication plan to communicate dam risks.  \nAdditionally, there are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The Chippewa and Minnesota Rivers diverge near Watson, Minnesota and recombine about 8 miles downstream in Montevideo, Minnesota.  The Chippewa Diversion dam regulates the flow split between the Chippewa and Minnesota Rivers, and is a component of the Lac qui Parle (LQP) reservoir project.  The LQP project is located on the Minnesota River in western Minnesota near the South Dakota state line.  The LQP project traces its impetus to a flood in 1919, although the eventual congressional authorization includes multiple purposes related to wildlife conservation.  The Chippewa dam was initially constructed by the State of Minnesota\u2019s Public Works Administration beginning in 1934 and subsequently accepted as a federal Works Progress Administration project in 1936.    Upon transfer to the Army Corps of Engineers, several modifications were recommended in 1947 and completed in 1951 (including adding the Tainter gate to the Chippewa Dam).   Chippewa County Highway 13 bridge crosses Chippewa dam, and a 4-ft x 4-ft box conduit passing under the highway for low-flows.  Chippewa Dam and the adjacent Watson Sag weir on Chippewa County Road 9 operate jointly to regulate the flow split, so are listed jointly as one dam (NID MN00578). There is about 3-1/2 miles of embankments associated with the two structures.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE currently has Chippewa & Watson listed as moderate-risk dams (DSAC-3) among its more than 700 dams.  The risk ranking is based on a screening-level assessment in 2009 that cited concerns for overtopping (especially near the abutments and wingwalls of the two structures where velocities are higher) and intermittent scour downstream of Chippewa.  The potential consequences of a breach in Chippewa during large floods only impact downstream water surface profiles by a few inches, so consequences related to the dam performance are minimal.  Therefore, Chippewa and Watson are listed as low hazard dams.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public.  USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.   Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Denison Dam in 1944 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.   Denison Dam forms a reservoir called Lake Texoma Additional purposes included regulation of flows on the Red River, water supply, hydropower, recreation, navigation, and other beneficial uses including fish & wildlife.  Denison Dam is located on the Red River, on the border of Texas and Oklahoma, approximately 5 miles northwest of Denison, Texas. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  After the storm passes and the Red River level recedes, the water can be safety released into the river.  Water storage and releases are managed by a conduit structure through the embankment. During larger floods, water is released over the ungated spillway. The project also includes a hydroelectric power plant that began operating in 1946 that generates power for the community.  Associated with the dam are also Cumberland Levees and Platter Dike. Cumberland Levees are located approximately 17 miles upstream of the dam along the Washita River. Platter Dike is located approximately 5 miles North-Northeast of the dam and closes off a low lying area near Platter, Oklahoma.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Denison Dam in 2012 and classified the risk associated with a potential dam breach as moderate.   Large populations living downstream of the dam contribute to the risk.   There is also risk associated with flooding downstream due to water flowing over the ungated spillway as part of normal operation during a large and widespread rainfall event.  Life loss and economic impacts for this scenario would still be possible, although the impacts would be less than if the dam were to breach.  The largest impacts for dam failure or large release would be to the cities of Denison, TX, Fulton, AR; Shreveport, Bossier City, Natchitoches, Pineville, and Alexandria, LA.   Bridges crossing the Red River and key infrastructure along the river from Denison, TX to Alexandria, LA could also be damaged or destroyed.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Denison Dam poses to the community.  A detailed risk assessment began in 2020 to further evaluate the project risk and determine if any remedial measures are warranted.  Additional activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis include emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The Jerry F. Costello Lock and Dam is located near the confluence of the Kaskaskia River with the Mississippi River at Kaskaskia River mile 0.8 in a relocated portion of river channel known as the Kaskaskia River Project in Randolph County, Illinois approximately 20 miles north of Chester, Illinois. The lock consists of an 84-foot by 600-foot lock chamber founded on sand, gate bays, a culvert filling and emptying system with Tainter valves, lock Miter gates, upper and lower floating guidewalls, control house, control station, access bridge, and sheetpile/clay-plug cutoff. The dam is a reinforced concrete gravity structure founded on sand. It consists of a two 60-foot by 30-foot Tainter gates, spillway, cutoff walls extending into earthen embankment both left and right, walkway bridge, storage yard, and overhead monorail crane for placing bulkheads. The dam site is bounded on one side by the Prairie du Rocher Levee District levee (which has an approximate average maximum elevation of 397 feet NAVD88 in the vicinity of the project). The project has a drainage area of approximately 5,790 square miles. Jerry F. Costello Lock and Dam was authorized for commercial navigation, fish and wildlife restoration, and recreation. Flood control is not an authorized project purpose. The project was not designed for flood control, nor is it possible to operate the project for this purpose.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The Jerry F. Costello Lock and Dam is currently categorized as Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 5, which corresponds to a Very Low risk category. Although the Jerry F. Costello Lock and Dam has historically performed well, extreme river conditions and earthquake events may cause an impact to or loss of navigation. Even when the project operates as intended, the dynamic nature of the river could cause scouring around the structures. The scouring would have the potential to allow uplift pressures beneath the structures to increase if allowed to progress. The most devastating potential scenario, but significantly less likely to happen, would occur if the project was subjected to a larger earthquake during high headwater and low tailwater conditions. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, Jerry F. Costello Lock and Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of loss of navigation if any of these scenarios occurred. \nInundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce the risk of loss of navigation. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam, including underwater surveys of the river upstream, downstream, and around the project to monitor for changing conditions. The frequency of some of these checks increases when the difference between the headwater and tailwater reaches historic highs. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the project functioning properly. Special repairs to scoured areas have been performed and are monitored for effectiveness.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Hopkinton Dam from 1959 to 1962 across the Contoocook River. The dam holds back water during flood events and works together with nearby Everett Dam to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Merrimack River. Hopkinton Dam normally holds a 14 to 16-foot deep, permanent pool that is produced by a downstream dam whose pool backs up into the Hopkinton Dam reservoir. The dam was built in response to the severe flooding that occurred in the region in 1936. Since it began operations through 2021, the dam reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $241.9 million.\n\nThe dam is made of compacted earth and rock fill and is approximately 7.5 stories (75 feet) high. Three 11-foot by 11-foot rectangular concrete pipes called conduits pass through the dam.  Metal gates at the upstream side of the conduits are opened to allow water to pass through the dam and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events. Two dikes (Dike H-2 and Dike H-3), also composed of earth and rock fill, with approximate heights equivalent to 8 and 7 stories (77 and 66 feet) were constructed to close off low areas around the reservoir.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the spillway, a sloped concrete structure located at the western end of the nearby Dike H-3. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing. The spillway is approximately the length of a football field and approximately four and a half stories below the top of the dam and dikes.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Hopkinton Dam in 2021 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Low. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Hopkinton Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist. \n\nThere are also extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would result in failure of the dam and downstream flooding:  water seeping through or below the earth embankment results in voids within the dam as the soil erodes, potentially weakening the dam. Were any of these events to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Contoocook, Concord, and Manchester, NH and Lowell, MA are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities further downstream would also be impacted, but less so. \nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges. In a worst case scenario, you could see water higher than a three and a half story building.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists at Hopkinton Dam. There is very low risk to the public under normal circumstances. Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume normal operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we will take actions to reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of Hopkinton Dam and will modify operations if necessary to lower risk to the public. We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner. USACE is undertaking additional study to further understand the risk associated with Hopkinton Dam, and what, if any, actions can be completed to reduce the risk.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of R.S. Kerr Lock and Dam in 1970 with the primary purpose of navigation and hydropower generation.  The project also provides recreation and fish and wildlife benefits. R.S. Kerr Lock and Dam is located at navigation on the Arkansas River, approximately 8 miles south of the town of Sallisaw, OK.  The project consists of an earthen embankment, navigation lock, concrete spillway with gates, and hydropower plant. Under normal river conditions, the flows within the river are regulated by the concrete gated spillway to ensure river levels are high enough for navigation barge traffic.  During river flooding, the spillway gates are fully opened to allow as much water to pass through the structure as possible.  After the flood passes and the river level recedes, the project returns to normal river conditions.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in October 2023 and classified the risk associated with R.S. Kerr Lock and Dam as low.\u00a0 Although unlikely, the primary risks identified are: (1) the potential for water to flow over the top of the embankment leading to erosion and breach and (2) the potential for water to seep through the embankment resulting in erosion and breach.\u00a0 Failure of the dam would result in widespread downstream flooding and potential life loss along the Arkansas River including the cities of Fort Smith, AR; Van Buren, AR; Mulberry, AR; Ozark, AR.\u00a0 The assessment also identified that the spillway gates are in poor condition.\u00a0 If the gates were to fail, there would likely be impacts to navigation and hydropower but life loss would not be expected.\u00a0 \n\n\nWidespread flooding could also occur downstream as part of normal operation of the dam (when the gates are fully opened during a large flood).",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  USACE is performing rehabilitation and painting of the deteriorated gates, with additional work needed and planned in coming years.  Additional measures include conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam. Additionally, the dam is maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the Richard B. Russell Dam and Lake in 1984.  The dam, formerly Trotters Shoals Dam and Lake, was built across the Savannah River on the Georgia/South Carolina border in the counties of Elbert (Georgia) and Abbeville (South Carolina), and 60 miles upstream of the city of Augusta, Georgia.  There were several authorized purposes for the project:  flood risk reduction, hydropower production, recreation, additional stream flow regulation, water supply, and fish and wildlife management.  The dam is operated as a system in conjunction with two other USACE dams located immediately upstream and downstream of Russell Dam:  Hartwell and J. Strom Thurmond.  The system of dams aids in the reduction of downstream flooding by holding back water during major storm events.  The Russell Dam structure consists of a large concrete dam section with earthen embankments on either side.  A gated spillway exists within the concrete section.  The spillway contains ten large, rotating gates called Tainter gates that can pass large volumes of water through the dam.  As the gates are raised, the dam can store more water within the reservoir which further minimizes downstream flooding.  Since construction of the dam, the spillway gates have never been opened due to flooding.  Altogether, Thurmond, Russell, and Hartwell dams have prevented approximately $370 million in flood damages since construction.  The Russell Dam hydropower plant produces an average annual output of 577,000 megawatt-hours of electrical energy.  This plant is unique in that it is a pump-back hydroelectric dam.  This means that at night, when electrical power demands are low, the generators can operate in reverse direction to pump water from below the dam back upstream into Russell Lake.  Then, the next day when peak power demand occurs, the stored water can be used to generate electricity.  This is especially beneficial during drought.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Richard B. Russell Dam in May 2017.  The assessment characterizes the risk of the project as very low.  The dam significantly reduces the risk of downstream flooding.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  During large storm events, Russell Dam\u2019s spillway gates will be opened to keep the reservoir level below the top of the spillway gates.  Russell\u2019s spillway moves water from the Russell Lake to the immediately downstream J. Strom Thurmond Lake.  Just downstream of Thurmond Dam and Lake is a large population of the city of Augusta, Georgia.  Thurmond Dam is able to aid in mitigation of flooding of this downstream population by slowing down releases and allowing time for the city to conduct preliminary evacuations and set Augusta Levee closures.    During an extreme storm event, an exceedingly large flow may need to be passed through Russell\u2019s and Thurmond\u2019s spillways to prevent the lakes from reaching the top of the dams.  These rare events will result in river flows that could overtop the Augusta Levee and impact widespread areas downstream of the dam with dangerous flood waters.  It is noted that Russell\u2019s spillway gates have never been opened due to flooding; all inflows to the lake have always been mitigated by passing water through the generators, however this may not always be the case.  Russell Dam is well maintained and has historically performed well with no issues of immediate concern.  However, there is a slight chance that a significant earthquake event may result in a breach of one of the embankments, or a failure of a part of the concrete dam structure.  This could result in deep and swift downstream flooding.  This is an unlikely event, but one that should be considered as a possibility.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking action to prepare for emergency incidents.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  USACE engineers and project personnel perform regular inspections of the dam and evaluate the dam\u2019s instrumentation.  These inspections and instrumentation evaluations are used to assess how the dam is performing.  The frequency of the inspections and instrumentation checks increases as the Russell Lake level rises in order to detect and identify any potential dam safety issues.  Periodic training is conducted with Russell Dam project personnel.  This training is to help project personnel, that are at the site on a daily basis, to identify the early warning signs of a potential issue with the dam.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.   Additionally, USACE works closely with Augusta-Richmond County during flood events.  The USACE operations plan for the downstream Thurmond Dam requires a stepped spillway release during major flood events and prospective/impending dam failure events.  This allows time for Augusta-Richmond County to close gate structures within the levee and to set levee stoplog closures before the full, required spillway releases are commenced.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built East Sidney Dam in 1950 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on Ouleout Creek in Delaware County, NY, approximately four miles upstream of the confluence with the Susquehanna River, six miles upstream of the village of Unadilla and eleven miles upstream of the village of Sidney. The Dam consists of an earthen embankment and concrete structure that create East Sidney Lake which provides recreation benefits.  Releases are made by gates which discharge flow through conduits in the concrete structure of the dam.  The top of the concrete structure serves as an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although East Sidney Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to Ouleout Creek.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen portion of the dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected instability and movement of portions of the concrete structure leading to a breach; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Unadilla, Sidney, and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along Ouleout Creek and the Susquehanna River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of East Sidney Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed the Carr Creek Dam project in 1975. The Carr Creek Lake Dam is located on Carr Creek, 8.8 miles above its confluence with the North Fork Kentucky River. The project is located in southeastern Kentucky, approximately 16 miles east of Hazard, Kentucky, and 160 air miles southeast of Louisville, Kentucky. The dam operates primarily as a unit with Buckhorn Dam to reduce flood stages in the upper Kentucky River Basin. The project also operates with other USACE lakes to reduce flood stages along the Ohio River. The areas that are most directly benefited include the cities of Hazard, Jackson, and\nBeattyville, Kentucky. A secondary purpose of the project is to provide storage for water supply, land water quality control and a pool for recreation and fish and wildlife activities. The drainage area is 58.2 square miles. It consists of a 750-foot-long earth and rock fill dam having a maximum height of 130 feet, a gate-controlled outlet works along the base of the right abutment, and a 265-foot-wide uncontrolled open cut spillway through the left abutment ridge upstream of the dam. The record pool elevation is 1049.5 feet NAVD88 which occurred on August 2, 2022.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Carr Creek Lake Dam in the 2023 Periodic Assessment Report, with a risk characterization of very low risk. A potential scenario that could cause uncontrolled release downstream, although extremely unlikely, is internal erosion at the rock foundation and embankment material interface. As the reservoir rises, the seepage flow velocity becomes high enough to initiate scour of the impervious core at the interface. The erosion of material leads to a collapse of fill zones, and nothing is present to act as a crack filler. The embankment consequently becomes unstable, and breach of the dam occurs. Erosion of the spillway during a significant precipitation event is also another extremely unlikely potential scenario. The geology of the spillway is conducive to erosion during an event that achieves spillway flow. As the reservoir rises, erosion of surficial material initiates and begins the erosion process. Continued rise of the reservoir results in increased flow velocities and deeper erosion into the unlined spillway channel. The erosion channel connects to the reservoir, circumvents the dam embankment, and results in increased uncontrolled discharge of the reservoir (breach).\nOvertopping of the embankment is also considered a potential failure mode. There is a lower elevation area at the right abutment along the crest of the dam. In the event of extreme precipitation, water would likely begin to flow in this lower elevation area and begin the erosion process. Once the grass cover is removed, continued and increased erosion is likely, potentially resulting in breach of the dam.\n\nDue to the proximity of the small towns of Vicco, Sassafras, Scuddy, and Happy, and the city of\nHazard (a distance of 15 miles downstream of the dam), the life loss consequences are\nexpected to be large. The short arrival time and the extreme depth of the flow would create\nalmost instant consequences for the surrounding downstream areas.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan (EAP), working closely with local emergency managers, and performing emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instrumentation to monitor the status of the dam and these inspections increase in frequency when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and may help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Lavon Dam in September 1953 in accordance with the River and Harbor Act approved 2 March 1945 (Public Law 14, 79th Congress, 1st Session). Lavon Dam was modified in 1974 based on the need for increased flood protection and water conservation authorized in the Flood Control Act of 1962, approved 23 October 1962 (Public Law 874, 87th Congress, 2nd Session, House Document No. 554). Lavon Dam was built on the East Fork of the Trinity River, to reduce the risk of flooding to the downstream Texas cities of Bardwell, Corsicana, and adjacent towns and counties. It is located 20 miles southeast of the City of McKinney in Collin County, Texas. Lavon Dam consists of earthen embankment sections that serves as the main water barrier and a controlled spillway to make discharges when water levels within the reservoir exceed the available flood storage. The main embankment is made up of soil and rock and is approximately 81 feet (about 8 stories) high at a crest elevation of 514.0-feet (NAVD88 vertical datum control). The dam is nearly four miles of earthen embankment except for the spillway located along the east end of the floodplain embankment. The spillway crest is at elevation 475.5-feet NAVD88 and includes a gated structure controlled by twelve radial arm lifting floodgates called Tainter gates, each measuring 40 feet by 28 feet and for a net opening of 480 feet across. The spillway can pass almost 3 million gallons per second, or enough water to flood a football field more than 6 feet deep every second. The reservoir is kept at or below the conservation pool elevation of 492.0-feet NAVD88 for most of the year. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir until the swollen streams and rivers below the dam recede and can handle the release of stored water minimizing loss of life, property, and negative impacts to the environment. Sometimes water must be released to protect the dam\u2019s integrity even though these streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity. Although reducing flood risk is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam also provides significant water supply to nearby communities and provides unique recreation opportunities. These benefits significantly improve the quality of life in the area.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Lavon Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding due to floodwaters passed through the dam are high volume releases from the operation of Lavon Dam during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded, requiring opening of Tainter gates and causing flooding downstream of the dam and at Lake Ray Hubbard, immediately downstream. Lavon Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. Generally, the Trinity River's large floods are long-duration type lasting weeks or even months; however, it is possible that large peak and volume floods could occur in about two weeks duration. Despite the flood reduction benefits the dam provides, very rare, severe storms could still produce high surcharge releases with the potential to impact the communities of Wylie, Rockwall, Rowlett, Forney, Mesquite, and Seagoville.\n\nIn April 2017, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment to evaluate the potential hazards to the dam, expected performance, and associated consequences. The risk assessment classified the risk associated with Lavon Dam as low. Risk for Lavon Dam is driven by the potential for water from the reservoir to seep through the earthen embankment at the ends of the dam causing voids as the soil erodes and by water flowing over the top of the dam, potentially leading to erosion of the embankment and an eventual dam breach. While this event is unlikely, consequences include the potential for loss of life. The largest impacts would be in Mesquite, Texas, located approximately 28 river miles below the dam. Lake Ray Hubbard is located 4 miles downstream and is impounded by Rockwall-Forney Dam (NID ID TX00837), which is located 24 miles downstream. Lake Ray Hubbard cannot retain much flood water and would have to make releases through the dam\u2019s fourteen Tainter gates to avoid exceeding capacity. Small agricultural levees would overflow from the flood waters in the rural area further downstream. Although the downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans, local emergency managers who are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, and who meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, breach of the dam could result in major flooding downstream and include significant economic impacts and put lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes; regularly updating the Lavon Dam Emergency Action Plan; and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and increased surveillance during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Instrumentation and monitoring systems allow USACE staff to monitor the dam for changing conditions that may not be seen at the surface. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

The flood control is primarily effective for spring snow melt events the storage is wholly achieved by pool drawdowns.",
    "riskCharSummary": "A risk assessment was conducted on Homme in 2015 that evaluated three potential failure modes.  These included concentrated leak erosion along the conduit, internal erosion below the fixed crest spillway, and a hydraulic jump seep-out in the spillway stilling basin at extreme floods.  The spillway was reconstructed in 2000 primarily because of a similar internal erosion distress, and the conduit was grouted in the 1980's because of concerns for concentrated leak erosion.  The risk of all potential failure modes was determined to be low and tolerable.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks. The fixed crest spillway at Homme was relocated and reconstruction in 2001 as a dam safety modification.",

Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Aylesworth Dam in 1970 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on Aylesworth Creek in Lackawanna County, PA near the confluence with the Lackawanna River, approximately one mile upstream of the borough of Jermyn and approximately ten miles upstream of Scranton. The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Aylesworth Creek Lake which provides water quality and recreation benefits.  Flow discharges through a conduit beneath the dam and the project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.  A small earthen embankment named Mayfield Dike is associated with the project and is located approximately three-quarters of a mile northeast of the dam.  This dike is listed separately within the National Inventory of Dams and, during large floods, blocks water from flowing out of Aylesworth Creek Lake at an area of low ground.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Aylesworth Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to Aylesworth Creek.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or  unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Jermyn, Dickson City, Scranton, and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Lackawanna River and North Branch Susquehanna River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",

The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. Shelbyville Dam is a high hazard dam located at river mile 197.9 on the Kaskaskia River in Shelby County, Illinois, approximately one-half mile east and one-fourth mile north of the city of Shelbyville. The dam is located 103.7 miles above Carlyle Lake. The Shelbyville Reservoir was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 3 July 1958 for flood control and related purposes. This act authorized the plan of improvement for the Kaskaskia River substantially as recommended by the Chief of Engineers in House Document No. 232, 85th Congress, first session; which plan consists of a dam and reservoir at Shelbyville (mile 221.8), levees between Cowden and Vandalia (miles 148-191), a dam and reservoir at Carlyle (mile 107), levees between Carlyle and New Athens (miles 49-103), and protection for the town of New Athens (mile 41). The contract for construction of the main dam was awarded 31 March 1966. The project's main purposes are flood control, fish and wildlife conservation, recreation, downstream water quality control, water supply, and to augment stream flow for navigation purposes on the lower 32 miles of the Kaskaskia River and the Mississippi River.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Shelbyville Dam in 2023 which evaluated the dam as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 5, which characterizes the risk as very low and is USACE\u2019s lowest risk category. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream and surrounding communities but does not entirely eliminate all risk. Although the project has historically performed well, an extreme precipitation event may cause flooding, even though the dam is performing as designed. Failure of the dam is defined as the sudden and uncontrolled release of water. Two potential failure modes were identified by the risk assessment with the most probable being a sinkhole developing within the dam embankment from a mine shaft that was missed by the mine treating program during construction. This could lower the crest of the dam leading to overtopping. The second, which is significantly less probable, is overtopping due to an extremely rare precipitation event for a duration that leads to breach. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, USACE is taking a proactive approach of monitoring for signs of distress, calculating pool fluctuations and adjusting operations based off weather forecast to prevent unnecessary risk, and ensuring preparedness with local community emergency personnel.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing impactful risk-reduction activities, and engaging with upstream and downstream emergency managers, as well as members of the public, to raise awareness and support preparedness for a potential dam-related emergency.  USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam which include inundation maps that have been released to the public via the NID. \n\nIn addition to emergency preparedness, routine instrumentation measurements, inspections, and risk assessments are conducted to ensure the structures are performing as designed. Increased surveillance occurs when hazards exceed pre-established thresholds. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as necessary to keep the dam functioning properly. Subject matter experts are monitoring weather patterns, expected precipitation, regional conditions, and pool levels to anticipate impacts, make projections, and advise on deviations in order to further reduce the risk of an extreme loading event.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the Peoria Lock and Dam in 1939 for the purpose of navigation.  Peoria Lock and Dam is located on the Illinois River in Creve Coeur, Illinois, about 5 river miles southwest of downtown Peoria, Illinois. The project consists of a lock chamber, a pool regulating dam Tainter gate, a wicket dam, an abandoned pool regulating structure, and an earthen embankment. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 11 feet, depending on the river conditions. The Tainter gate is used to control the water levels on the upstream pool and is 84 feet long. The 432 feet long wicket dam consists of 108 panels that can be raised to hold a pool or lowered to create an open river depending on the river flows. When flows are high enough to maintain minimum navigation depths without the dam, the wickets are lowered to the riverbed and traffic can bypass the lock by travelling over the lowered wickets. When river flows are low enough to not allow minimum navigation depths without the dam, the wickets are raised to hold an upstream pool, requiring river traffic to pass through the lock chamber to continue up or down the river. The abandoned regulating structure was once used to regulate the upstream water levels but was replaced by the Tainter gate and abandoned in place. The earthen embankment connects the abandoned regulating structure to high ground and is about 2,700 feet long. During flood events on the Illinois River, the wickets are lowered to the riverbed, the Tainter gate is raised above the predicted water levels, and the lock chamber goes under water. Once water levels recede, the site is cleaned and normal operation of the project features resume. The biggest flood on record was on April 24, 2013 and submerged the lock chamber by 16 feet and 7 inches.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in July 2021 and classified the risk associated with Peoria Lock and Dam as very low. The risk assessment investigated the potential for scour downstream of the dam and a barge impact into the wickets. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Peoria Lock and Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the lock and dam to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The West Point Dam was authorized by Congress in the 1962 under the Flood Control Act to generate hydropower, reduce flooding in downstream communities, and to provide for recreation.  West Point Dam is located on the Chattahoochee River about 3 miles north of West Point, Georgia.  It was designed and constructed from 1966 to 1975 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and resulted in the formation of West Point Lake, a 40 square mile reservoir, that supplies water to Georgia and Alabama.\n\nThe West Point Dam is constructed of concrete and earthen dams and includes a powerhouse and a gated spillway.  Water is released to the river downstream through the spillway and the powerhouse.  The overall dam length is 7,250 feet, with a crest elevation of 652 feet. The length of the concrete portion of the dam is 896 feet.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2016 which classified the risks associated with the project as moderate.  The classification was driven by the condition of concrete bulkheads in the powerhouse.   Structural modifications to address this issue were completed in 2020.   The The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Lanett, AL and West Point, GA are located nearby about 3 miles downstream of the dam.  During large storm events, the dam\u2019s spillway gates will be opened to keep the reservoir level below the top of the spillway gates.  As the gates rise open, the flow in the river downstream is increased and more water is allowed to be held in the reservoir.  During an extreme storm event, an exceedingly large flow may need to be passed through the spillway to prevent the lake from reaching the top of the dam and downstream flooding will occur.  In the highly unlikely event of a dam failure, flood waters would be very swift and deep and cause catastrophic flooding, widespread economic impacts, and life loss, particularly in the vicinity of West Point, GA and Lanett, AL and have severe impacts downstream in communities such as Phenix City, AL: and Columbus, GA.  Key infrastructure along the river would be damaged or destroyed and historic flooding would occur all the way to the Gulf of America, impacting the states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Wright Patman Dam in 1954 with the project purpose to provide flood risk management, water supply, environmental regulation, and recreation. Wright Patman Dam is located on the Sulphur River about 9 miles southwest of Texarkana, Texas. The project is one of 17 USACE flood control projects in a comprehensive plan for flood control on the Red River below Denison Dam, Texas. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $129 million (adjusted to 2019 dollars). Wright Patman Dam works in conjunction with Cooper Dam (National Inventory of Dams TX08012) to regulate flows along the Sulphur River which feeds into the Red River. During large storm events, the dam temporarily stores flood waters to manage flooding downstream. After the storm passes and the Red River recedes, water can be safety released downstream in accordance with the approved water control plan. Water storage and releases are managed by four water control gates operated by onsite USACE personnel. The project is primarily an earthen embankment dam and includes a 200-foot wide concrete spillway to regulate the reservoir when its flood storage capacity becomes exhausted as the pool rises above spillway crest elevation 259.5 feet, which is 26.5 feet below top of dam elevation of 286.0 feet.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Wright Patman Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding are high volume releases from Wright Patman Dam through the un-gated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Wright Patman Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment in 2022 and classified the risk associated with Wright Patman Dam as very low. This risk classification is primarily driven by the very low probability for dam failure and the number of large populations at risk below Wright Patman Dam. The potential of breach for Wright Patman Dam was assessed to be related to two primary risks associated with earthen embankment dams: 1) During an extreme flood event, the foundation upon which the dam was built may experience excessive pressures beyond its design which could then lead to erosion of the embankment foundation and eventual breach of the dam, and 2) Differential settlement over time can increase the chance for cracks through the embankment which could reduce the projects ability to withstand large flood events. In the remote event of a dam breach the largest impacts would be to the cities of Shreveport and Bossier City, Louisiana. Potentially impacted infrastructure includes road networks, electrical substations, communication facilities, police and fire stations, hospitals, airports, and schools. In addition, should a breach occur levees in the downstream populated areas would experience overtopping and would not contain the floodwaters. Although the downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans; and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure; and local emergency managers meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, breach of the dam from either risk category could result in catastrophic flooding downstream and include widespread economic impacts and significant loss of life.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is continually taking proactive steps to reduce risk and ensure public safety. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning; annual updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions; and development of a detailed communications plan for the dam. USACE will continue to identify and implement risk reduction measures such as stockpiling materials to mitigate the potential for erosion of the embankment or foundation. Additionally, the dam is well maintained and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and increased surveillance during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions and there are also pre-positioned materials at the project site to perform immediate flood fighting activities as necessary.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built and completed Mariposa Dam in 1949. Mariposa Dam is one of four dams that are a part of the Merced County Stream Group Project that was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944. Mariposa Dam is located about 18 miles east of Merced, California on Mariposa Creek. The dam structure consists of an earthfill embankment that includes an unlined and ungated spillway located near the eastern end of the dam. In addition, the project consists of two dikes and an ungated outlet works. The Mariposa Dam project was constructed solely for flood risk reduction purposes and is typically a dry dam, only holding back water during large rain events. The dam controls runoff from 107 square miles of foothill and mountain drainage.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Mariposa Dam has historically performed well and significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not fully eliminate the potential for downstream flooding. USACE completed a risk assessment for Mariposa Dam in 2019 and classified the risks associated with the project as moderate. USACE identified two primary areas of dam safety concern regarding Mariposa Dam: the lack of spillway adequacy and the potential for water to overtop the dam during an extreme flood event. During an extreme flood event, the high flow of water over the unlined and ungated spillway could cause erosion in the spillway channel, which can potentially undermine the spillway control structure, eventually leading to downstream flooding. Another scenario that could potentially cause significant downstream flooding is if water flows over the top of the dam due to an extremely rare and large flood event. This unlikely event would cause significant property damage and potentially harm people downstream. Potentially impacted infrastructure includes road networks, communication facilities, electric substations, police and fire stations, hospitals, schools, and an airport. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, there is an emergency action plan for Mariposa Dam to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works closely with local emergency managers, regularly updates the emergency action plan, and conducts emergency exercises with state, federal, and local partners, all of which help reduce risk to the public. USACE performs regular inspections and instrument monitoring to ensure that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. The frequency of these checks increases when Mariposa Lake rises. USACE incorporates weather forecasts to make informed decisions on how to operate the dam. In most scenarios, the downstream communities would have a coordinated warning notification within hours depending on location before water reaches their homes. However, during very large and rare earthquake events, there may be little to no warning.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "A risk assessment of the Whitlow Ranch Dam was completed by USACE in 2020.  The risk identified during this study determined the dam to be a low risk due the combination of life, economic, or environmental consequences of likelihood of failure to unacceptable except in unusual circumstances.  The main fact driving the risk of Whitlow Ranch Dam is erosion of the earthen embankment foundation along a seismic fault in the foundation.  The primary consequence center for this dam is Queen Creek, AZ with a population at risk of greater than 285,000.  Economic consequences were estimated to be over $6 Billion.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The Abiquiu Dam project is owned and operated by the Albuquerque District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The project includes a dam located on the Rio Chama in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, about 14 river miles upstream of the town of Abiquiu and 32 river miles from its confluence with the Rio Grande.  Construction was completed in 1963 and primary project features include a zoned earthen embankment dam, gated outlet works to adjust operational water release into the Rio Chama; and rock-cut spillway to pass much larger, uncontrolled flows during extreme events.  During flood events, the Abiquiu Dam project can be operated for flood risk reduction on its own or in conjunction with other dams to optimize upstream and downstream flood risk reduction within the Rio Grande Basin.  In addition to the project\u2019s main purpose of flood risk reduction, it is also authorized for water supply, power generation; recreation; and fish & wildlife benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although the Abiquiu Dam project has successfully reduced flooding, it does not eliminate all flood risk caused by rain downstream of the dam or due to emergency operation of the project.  During infrequent emergency operation, larger required releases through the project\u2019s gated outlet works would surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Rio Chama and Rio Grande to Cochiti Lake.  Additionally, at high lake levels portions of State Highway 84, upstream of the project near Ghost Ranch, and State Highway 96 may be flooded.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled flow through the spillway have never occurred, uncontrolled spillway flow could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Rio Chama and Rio Grande, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Chama and Rio Grande to Cochiti Lake.  Impacted communities include Abiquiu, Mendenales, Chamita, Hernandez, Ohkay Owingeh, Espa\u00f1ola, Santa Clara Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, and communities located in between.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment of the Abiquiu Dam project in 2019.  Results generally characterize dam breach risk as LOW due to the combination of life loss consequences and low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the result of an extreme event.  Specifically, the occurrence of dam breach caused by seepage induced loss of earthen embankment material into the joints of the adjacent canyon abutment rock during high pools was identified.  For high lake levels that can occur during normal operation or during an extreme event, the annual probability of dam breach due to seepage loss of embankment dam materials is estimated to be low (1 in 1,000,000).  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation would be life threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Chama and Rio Grande to Cochiti Lake.  Impacted communities include Abiquiu, Mendenales, Chamita, Hernandez, Ohkay Owingeh, Espa\u00f1ola, Santa Clara Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, and communities located in between.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquakes or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  An Issue Evaluation Study was completed in 2019 to assess dam breach risk and included investigation of project features and installation of additional instruments to improve performance monitoring.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included replacement of damaged sections of air vent pipes, repair of deteriorated rock protection, and installation of new seepage monitoring instruments.  A project to repair bulkhead gates and effort streamline instrument data collection is planned.  Risk communication includes conducting tabletop emergency exercises with first responders and other Federal, State, and local agencies.  Future risk communication activities include development of a formal risk communication plan and revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  Flood warnings to notify affected communities downstream of the project are coordinated with external entities.",

    "projectDescription": "Dorena Dam is located on the Row River six miles upstream of Cottage Grove, Oregon. Dorena Dam is a 145 ft tall, 2,600 ft long earthen embankment dam with an ungated 200 ft long concrete spillway and gated regulating outlets. Dorena Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam was completed in 1949. A privately owned hydropower facility was added to the dam and began operation in 2014. The hydropower facility is regulated by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Dorena Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season.\n\nDorena Dam is located about 65 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. The assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. USACE completed a routine risk assessment for Dorena Dam in 2022. The next routine risk assessment is scheduled to occur in 2032. \n\nThe 2022 risk assessment identified the risk associated with the dam to be \u201cLow.\u201d According to the 2022 assessment, an extreme flood could overtop the earthen embankment structure, or an extreme earthquake could cause damage to the earthen embankment dam leading to erosion of the embankment material.  Because Cottage Grove Dam is located upstream of Cottage Grove, Oregon, there is potential for flooding to affect downstream populations in Cottage Grove as well as rural communities in the floodplain areas.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE continues to evaluate the condition and risks associated with its dams and will continue to review the risk associated with Dorena Dam in future routine studies. The next routine risk assessment for Dorena Dam is scheduled for the spring of 2022. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Dorena Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Dorena Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Stillwater Dam in 1960 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on the Lackawanna River in Susquehanna County, PA, approximately four miles upstream of Forest City, thirty miles upstream of Scranton and forty miles upstream of the confluence with the Susquehanna River. The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Stillwater Lake which provides water supply benefits.  Primary releases are made by a gate which discharges flow through a conduit beneath the dam.  The project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Stillwater Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to the Lackawanna River.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or  unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Forest City, Carbondale, Dickson City, Scranton and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Lackawanna River and North Branch Susquehanna River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Stillwater Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Mahoning Dam across Mahoning Creek in 1941 to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in the low-lying communities including Putneyville, Kittanning, Ford City, the greater Pittsburgh area, and additional towns on the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.  The dam is located about 23 miles upstream of the confluence between Allegheny River and Mahoning Creek.  Mahoning Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $800 million since the start of operations. The reservoir stores rainfall to maintain downstream flow within the downstream river banks and releases water after flood events and in the late summer and fall; provides water to a non-federal hydropower facility; and provides numerous opportunities for recreation.  Mahoning Dam is composed of concrete and has a maximum height of 166.5 feet and a length of 926 feet.  The dam has five spillway gates designed to release a large volume of water during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.  The gates are composed of steel, and each is 29 feet high by 30 feet wide.  The gates are supported by concrete piers, which also support the bridge structure at the top of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Mahoning Dam was completed in 2022, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as very low. However, an extremely intense rainfall could fill the reservoir beyond its intended capacity.  Also, the concrete at the surface of the dam and in the piers that support the spillway gates is in poor condition.  This condition is not believed to affect the stability of the concrete dam but could increase the likelihood that one or more of the concrete piers could move downstream, which could release a large volume of water downstream. The nearest town downstream of Mahoning Dam is Putneyville, Pennsylvania and large populations are situated in Kittanning, Ford City, Pennsylvania.  The greater Pittsburgh area, and additional towns on the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers could be affected by flooding related to flow from Mahoning Dam in the event of extreme rainfall. Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding to these communities, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from Mahoning Dam would be high-volume flow of water through the dam\u2019s spillway, which has never happened since the start of dam operations in 1941) during an unusually large and intense storm event.  Alternatively, if one of the piers that supports the spillway gates This high-volume release could cause flooding within Mahoning Creek that would be similar to conditions that would exist if Mahoning Dam had not been constructed.\n\nA less likely and more devastating flooding scenario exists: an extreme rainfall event that results in reservoir water overtopping the dam, eroding the bedrock upon which the dam is founded, which could result in portions of the concrete dam moving downstream.  If this were to happen, the large volume of water in the Mahoning Creek Reservoir would cause severe flooding in the Mahoning Creek valley and significant flooding in the Allegheny River valley.\n\nIn either scenario, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Communities, including Putneyville, that are closer to the dam, are in more immediate danger of a significant flood event and may have little advanced warning.  Cities and communities further downstream of the dam, such as Kittanning, Ford City, communities in metropolitan Pittsburgh, and communities on the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers have larger populations and possibly less awareness of the dam but will have more warning. \n\nWith either of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, possibly overflowing banks on the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers, destroying buildings and infrastructure.  Anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the most likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently during high-water events.  Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high-water event is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses.  We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current lake levels at the Mahoning Creek Lake is available to the public via the internet at: \n\nhttps://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv/?site_no=03035500",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Lock & Dam 5 in 1935.  The project is located on the Mississippi River near Minnesota City, Minnesota. USACE operates Lock & Dam 5 primarily for navigation purposes, but congress also authorized USACE to make recreation improvements associated with the pool formed above the dam. Additionally, environmental management on the river is coordinated with the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources, and other state & federal agencies. The main components of the project include a lock, a gated spillway structure with 6 roller gates and 28 Tainter gates, and 3.5 miles of earthen embankments connecting these other components. The embankment has a crest elevation of 669.6 to 671.6 feet (NAVD 88) and a maximum height of 21 feet.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Lock & Dam 5 is a run-of-river dam that maintains a navigation pool for river traffic but does not store flood waters. The gated spillway is regulated to hold a constant pool level for navigation purposes at elevation 659.6 up to river flows of 116,000 cfs.  The 116,000 cfs is exceeded about 1 in 3 years.  Above this flow, the gates are fully opened, and the dam has less than one foot of impact on the river stages. The maximum water level differential across the dam is 9 feet and occurs at low river flows.  Based upon a screening-level assessment in 2008, USACE considers Lock & Dam 4 to be a moderate-risk dam among its more than 700 dams, but that is expected to be reduced to low-risk after a more detailed risk assessment. Identified risks included overtopping of the embankment, a deteriorated auxillary lock gate, and unconfirmed deterioration of low-flow conduits through the embankment.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.   Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Other hazards exist, such as swimming and boat safety in the vicinity of the dam.  USACE regularly engages the public to raise awareness of the dam; and coordinates with state and county emergency managers (particularly during river flood events).",

    "projectDescription": "Flood control structures at the Leesville Lake Project includes a rolled earth fill dam with an uncontrolled emergency spillway on the left abutment and outlet works located in the right abutment.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities; however, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Although Leesville Dam has historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event.  An event such as this could require unusually large quantities of water to be released. \n\nA 2018 risk assessment for Leesville Dam classified the risk of failure for the entire project system as very low.  The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the open spillway to the left (north) of the dam has the potential to pass up to thirty-one thousand cubic feet of water per second.   The uncontrolled spillway is designed to pass water to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.\n\nWhile the Leesville Dam spillway has never flowed.  If operated, it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Leesville, OH, and Sherrodsville, OH, to Dover, OH, and New Philadelphia, OH.  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along McGuire Creek and Conotton Creek, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows.  Although the odds of such a storm even occurring are considered extremely unlikely, Leesville Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any unanticipated scenarios were to occur.   \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach high elevations quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Leesville Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Leesville Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions, and flood fighting materials are stored onsite in case of an emergency.",

    "projectDescription": "Harlan County Dam is a high hazard dam located at river mile 239.4 on the Republican River in Harlan County, Nebraska, about 13 miles west of the town of Franklin, Nebraska. The dam consists of a zoned earthfill embankment and a concrete gravity type spillway control structure near the middle of the embankment. The rolled earthfill structure is 11,827 feet long and is 107 feet above the streambed. The embankment contains approximately 13,400,000 cubic yards of earthfill. The spillway control structure consists of a controlled overfall spillway and a stilling basin; it was constructed using approximately 430,000 cubic yards of concrete. The authorized project purposes include flood risk management, irrigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife habitat.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Risk at Harlan County Dam is driven by the potential for overtopping of the dam during an extreme flood event, the potential for sliding of the concrete dam section along the foundation, and the potential for embankment erosion at the interface between the earthen and concrete dam sections.  Risk for Harlan County Dam is currently considered high.  USACE will perform additional analysis to better understand the risks associated with the dam over the next several years.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \nUSACE hosts tabletop exercises with local emergency managers and first responders every two years since the dam is considered high risk.  USACE rehabilitated the spillway gates in 2018 to reduce the risk of a gate failure during operation.  The sluice gates used to make normal releases from the dam were also rehabilitated in 2018.  USACE is pursuing rehabilitation of the concrete spillway section of the dam, and investigating offsets in the concrete spillway sill below the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Hillsdale Dam, completing in 1982. Hillsdale Dam is located approximately 6 miles upstream of Paola, Kansas. Big Bull Creek is the lake\u2019s main tributary with Little Bull Creek also emptying into the lake. Discharges from the reservoir flow from Big Bull Creek into the Marais des Cygnes River. The dam was authorized for flood control, water supply, water quality control, recreation, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Hillsdale Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $16.6 million (2020 price level) from 2013 to 2019. The dam is a rolled earthfill embankment approximately 9,050 feet long with an uncontrolled spillway located 2,500 feet beyond its right abutment.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed the Hillsdale Lake storage capacity can require the release of water through the outlet works or the uncontrolled spillway, even if the rivers and creeks are at or beyond capacity to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam. This can result in flooding areas downstream including agricultural land and the community of Paola, 4-7 miles downstream of the dam.  \nUSACE completed a risk assessment for Hillsdale Dam in June 2020 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as very low.  If a dam breach were to occur, this would result in the immediate release of water, flooding the agricultural land downstream of the dam and the community of Paola, KS.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high reservoir levels. Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high reservoir level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of DeGray Dam in 1971 and continues to own, operate, and maintain the facility. Located on the Caddo River, approximately 7 miles northwest of Arkadelphia, Arkansas, the dam provides critical flood risk reduction, hydroelectric power generation, water supply, and recreational opportunities to the region. The project protects downstream areas including Caddo Valley and Arkadelphia, where flood damage reduction benefits extend to hundreds of residents and vital infrastructure.\n\nDeGray Dam is a 243-foot-tall, earth-fill embankment structure stretching approximately 3,400 feet across the valley floor. It is accompanied by a 13,200-foot-long saddle dike to the east, which helps contain the reservoir pool during high water events. Arkansas Highway 7 crosses over the saddle dike, providing critical transportation access to the area.\n\nWater is released from the dam through a gated concrete outlet works structure located in the right abutment. The outlet system includes a 29-foot-diameter flood control tunnel and branch tunnels that feed a powerhouse with a 40,000-kilowatt conventional unit and a 28,000-kilowatt pump-turbine unit, which produces enough power to power 5 million homes for one day. \nAn unlined overflow spillway is located 4,000 feet east of the dam on a natural sandstone saddle. Though never used since construction, this broad-crested spillway can safely pass extreme flood flows without overtopping the dam. The combination of outlet works, and spillway ensures safe passage of floodwaters in accordance with USACE standards.\n\nThe DeGray embankment is constructed of a zoned earth-fill design with a central impervious clay core and random material outer shells. While the dam performs well under current loading, localized areas of concern such as potential erosion at the abutment contacts and low-lying sections of the crest have been identified through USACE inspections. A paved crest roadway, downstream sand filter drains, and a robust instrumentation system enhance long-term performance monitoring. The dam remains in overall good condition and continues to provide vital risk reduction and multi-purpose benefits to central Arkansas.\n\nTo prepare your family against possible flooding, please visit the National Inventory of Dams (NID) website to see maps showing the potential extent of flooding locations if Blakely Mountain Dam were to breach.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While DeGray Dam significantly reduces flood risks for communities downstream\u2014particularly Caddo Valley and portions of Arkadelphia\u2014it does not eliminate those risks entirely. Flooding can still occur even when the dam operates exactly as designed. Unlikely but possible large rainfall events could generate inflows that exceed the dam\u2019s outlet capacity. In these rare cases, the overflow spillway\u2014an unlined channel carved into natural sandstone east of the dam\u2014could activate to safely pass excess water and prevent overtopping of the dam itself.\n\nIf the overflow spillway were to activate, floodwaters could affect low-lying areas downstream, including farmland and infrastructure along the Caddo River. During these scenarios, floodwaters would also back up tributaries such as Caney Creek, with water levels potentially reaching vulnerable facilities near the Caddo Valley community. Although life loss is not expected in non-breach events, homes, roadways, and emergency services may be affected, especially if warning times are short or public response is delayed.\n\nUSACE has modeled numerous extreme event scenarios and determined that failure of DeGray Dam, although unlikely, would have serious consequences. In a breach scenario, deep and fast-moving floodwaters would reach Caddo Valley within approximately one hour with expected life loss consequences. These floodwaters would be capable of destroying homes, bridges, highways, and critical infrastructure, with impacts reaching as far as Arkadelphia and even low-lying parts of Camden, 78 miles downstream.\n\nThe most significant failure risks involve internal erosion at abutment contacts or cracking from differential settlement. These potential failure modes are considered unlikely but if they were to occur, they could develop slowly, providing time for detection and emergency action. \n\nDeGray Dam has performed reliably since its completion in 1971 and is currently classified as a DSAC 4 (Low Urgency) facility by USACE. This means that while the probability of failure is low, the dam\u2019s high hazard classification requires ongoing vigilance. Residents downstream should remain informed and follow all instructions from local emergency officials in the rare event of severe flooding. USACE encourages residents to review flood inundation maps available through the National Inventory of Dams (NID) and local emergency management offices.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure DeGray Dam continues to safely manage floodwaters and support its authorized project purposes\u2014including hydropower generation, water supply, and recreation\u2014USACE relies on state-of-the-art modeling tools, real-time rainfall forecasts, and upstream stream gauge data to predict lake elevations and anticipate downstream impacts. USACE routinely inspects the dam, collects and analyzes instrumentation data, and reassesses risks as new information becomes available.\n\nIn response to risks identified in the most recent Periodic Assessment, USACE has recommended several targeted actions to maintain the long-term integrity of the dam and reduce risk. These include surveying and verifying crest elevations on the saddle dike to ensure adequate freeboard during high pool events and improving the visibility and functionality of piezometer monitoring systems across the project. Monitoring of abutment contacts and seepage areas continues on a routine basis to detect any potential early signs of internal erosion, although none have been observed to date.\n\nUSACE has also identified and plans to address minor maintenance items such as vegetation management on embankment slopes, removal of obstructions from rockfill blankets, and updating corrosion protection measures on mechanical gate systems. The Water Control Manual will be revised to ensure reservoir operations reflect the latest hydrologic conditions and risk-informed decision-making.\n\nWhile no structural repairs are currently deemed necessary, USACE has implemented proactive monitoring strategies and stands ready to escalate surveillance and operational controls during flood events. In such cases, trained personnel initiate 24-hour monitoring in accordance with the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\nUSACE continues to coordinate closely with the National Weather Service (NWS), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM), and local emergency responders. Joint emergency exercises are held periodically to ensure preparedness and improve community response in the event of a dam-related incident. This multi-agency collaboration ensures timely warnings and protective actions can be taken if extreme weather or operational challenges arise.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Fall River Dam in 1948 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities as well as water quality, water supply, fish and wildlife, and recreation.  Fall River Dam is located on the Fall River about miles Northwest of Neodesha, Kansas.  Fall River Dam consists of an earth fill embankment, a concrete spillway with 8 large gates, and an outlet works that is an integral part of the spillway structure.  The outlet works has seven smaller gates, one low flow pipe, and water supply pipe which is not currently used.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in February 2019 and classified the risk associated with Fall River Dam as moderate. This classification is based primarily on the potential for a very rare flood to occur that results in water flowing over the top of the dam even though the maximum release possible is being made from the spillway gates.  Overtopping would ultimately result in erosion and breach of the embankment dam. There are relatively small populations living downstream of the dam that would be flooded in the event of a failure of the dam. Failure of the dam would result in flooding in Fall River, Fredonia, Neodesha, and Coffeyville KS. \nA more likely scenario for flooding includes normal operation of the Dam during a large flood which results in large releases through the spillway gates as intended.  Although this would result in less flooding than dam failure, this event could still result in significant widespread flooding and result in loss of life and economic impacts.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Fall River Dam poses to communities.  Along with routine inspections and surveys, an Interim Risk Reduction Measures Plan has been developed to address the annually updated Emergency Action Plan, identifying available equipment for emergency response, establishing emergency rock and sand stockpiles, emergency exercises, and a communication plan.  \nAdditionally, there are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "Applegate Dam is located on the Applegate River in Jackson County, 13 miles south of Ruch, Ore. near the Oregon-California Border. The dam is located near the northern base of the Siskiyou Mountain Range. Applegate Dam is a 242-foot tall, 1300-foot long rockfill and gravel earthen embankment dam with a concrete spillway, two spillway gates, a 240-foot tall concrete multiple-level withdrawal structure, and regulating outlet. The dam was constructed from 1979 to 1981. The authorized purposes of the project are flood risk management, irrigation, fish and wildlife enhancement, water quality, and recreation. The watershed above Applegate Dam is 223 square miles and predominantly forest land. Applegate Dam regulates flood waters for areas downstream along the Applegate and Rogue including the communities of McKee Bridge, Applegate, Wilderville, and Gold Beach, Ore. \n\nApplegate Dam is operated to reduce flooding during winter and spring months by temporarily holding back inflow to the reservoir and releasing flood waters after unregulated flows subside. Applegate Reservoir is re-filled throughout the spring months as major flood season transitions into conservation season.  The stored water is released to increase the summer and fall flows of Applegate River and to a lesser extent the navigable portion of the Rogue River.  The releases help to provide steady flow for fish habitat and irrigation throughout drier months. The multiple-level withdrawal structure that allows for the regulation of the water temperature released from the reservoir. The gated spillway allows for the passage of large flood events that fill the available flood storage in the reservoir. The spillway has a capacity to pass a maximum flood flow of approximately 100,000 cfs. The spillway has been used to pass flood flows one time in January 1997 with a maximum discharge measured at 16,500 cfs.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment on the Applegate Dam in 2019 that characterized the life-safety risks associated with the project as Moderate. The risk assessment found the risk to be driven by an unlikely scenario in which an extreme flood causes water to flow over portions of the earthen embankment dam not designed to convey water, causing erosion and potential for breach. Applegate Dam\u2019s ability to pass extreme floods is limited to the size of its two spillway gates. When the gates are fully open, there is potential that the opening is simply not large enough to safely release the amount of water required in very large storm events. Overtopping of the dam could result in additional water flow in the river downstream, which may lead to loss of life and damage to land and property. \nApplegate Dam is located approximately 55 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone can produce very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700. Applegate Dam is expected to perform well in most earthquakes, including those produced by the Cascadia Subduction Zone.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Applegate Dam is well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the flood risk management dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The likelihood is very low for an extreme flood to occur that would overtop Applegate Dam, but the potential impacts of a dam failure are high due to the population downstream along the narrow river canyon. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Applegate Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Applegate Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of John Redmond Dam in 1964 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities as well as water quality, water supply, fish and wildlife, and recreation.  John Redmond Dam is located on the Neosho River in Coffey County, Kansas approximately 2 miles northwest of Burlington, Kansas.  The Neosho River is a tributary of the Arkansas River.  The dam consists of an earth-fill embankment and a gated concrete spillway.  Associated with the Dam is also the Hartford Levee which was constructed to reduce flood risk to the town of Hartford, Kansas due to high lake levels in John Redmond Reservoir.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for John Redmond Dam in 2022 and classified the risk associated with the dam as moderate. The risk is driven by the potential for water to flow over the embankment crest during a very extreme flood event resulting in embankment erosion and breach. Failure of the dam would include downstream flooding, widespread economic impacts, and significant loss of life. In the remote event of a dam failure the towns of Burlington, LeRoy, Neosho Falls, Iola, Humboldt, Chanute, Erie, St. Paul, Oswego, and Chetopa in Kansas and Miami in Oklahoma would be impacted.\n\nThere is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation which could include large releases through the gated spillway.  Although the flooding would be less significant during this scenario compared to a dam breach, widespread economic impacts and life loss could still occur depending on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts to help manage the risk that John Redmond Dam poses to downstream communities. These include conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the EAP to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam and levee. The dam and levee are well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam and levee during both normal lake levels and flood events to ensure the integrity of the structures. Lastly, the dam and levee have a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam and levee for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Tenkiller Dam in 1953 with the primary purpose if reducing flooding downstream.  The dam also was constructed for purposes of water supply, water quality, recreation, fish and wildlife, and hydropower.  The dam is located in eastern Oklahoma in Sequoyah County about 7 miles northeast of Gore, Oklahoma. The project consists of an earthen embankment, a tunnel for making flood releases, two concrete spillways with gates for larger flood releases, and a hydroelectric power plant that generates power for Sequoyah County. Oklahoma State Highway 100 runs across the top of the dam, which connects the town of Gore and the city of Tahlequah.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2019 and classified the risk associated with Tenkiller Dam as low. Although extremely unlikely, the two primary risks to the integrity of the dam are: (1) the potential for a flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded and water flows over the top of the dam even with maximum possible releases being made through the gates, and (2) inability to open the spillway gates due to mechanical or electrical failure of the spillway gates leads to water flowing over the top of the dam.  In the remote event of a dam failure, the most immediate impacts would be to the towns of Gore and Webbers Falls in Oklahoma, and Fort Smith and Van Buren in Arkansas.\n\nA more likely flooding scenario includes a large release through the gated spillway during a flood with the project operating as intended.   Although the inundation would not be as great as a breach of the dam, this scenario could still result in widespread economic impacts and loss of life due to the extent of the flooding possible as part of normal operation of the dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Tenkiller Dam poses to the community. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam. Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Caesar Creek Dam in 1975. Caesar Creek Dam is located approximately three miles above the mouth of Caesar Creek, a tributary to the Little Miami River, and approximately 30 miles northeast of Cincinnati, OH. The Caesar Creek Dam project consists of an earth and rock fill dam embankment, gated outlet works, and uncontrolled open cut spillway. The dam embankment is 2,650-foot-long with a maximum height of 165 feet. There are four earthen dikes upstream from the dam that prevent high reservoir pools from spilling over topographic low points. These dikes range from 600 feet to over a mile in length and 7 to 67 feet tall. Caesar Creek Dam reduces flooding along the Little Miami River and serves a drainage area of 237 square miles. The record pool EL. 870.73 feet NAVD88 \noccurred on January 19, 2005. The dam has never experienced a spillway flow event.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Caesar Creek Dam in 2020 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4 which is considered Low relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not completely eliminate the risk. While Caesar Creek Dam has historically performed well, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway. There is also an unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is erosion of the dam's earthen embankment during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach of the dam. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along Caesar Creek and the Little Miami River.\n\nThe largest impacts would be to residents along the Little Miami River from the dam to its confluence with the Ohio River including the communities of South Lebanon, Loveland, and Milford, Ohio. There would also be backwater impacts and flooding North of the Caesar Creek and Little Miami River confluence impacting the communities of Waynesville and Corwin, Ohio. This upstream area would also be more immediately impacted should one of the Reservoir Dikes experience a failure.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan and conducting emergency exercises with state and local emergency management agencies to ensure all key stakeholders understand their roles and responsibilities in the case of a dam related emergency. USACE utilizes the latest forecast, and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Toronto Dam in 1949 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities in addition to water supply, water quality, fish and wildlife, and recreation purposes.  Toronto Dam is located on the Verdigris River, 4 miles north of Coyville, Kansas.  Toronto Dam consists of an earth-fill embankment and a concrete spillway controlled by eight large gates used for flood releases.  The concrete spillway also has seven smaller gates through the structure for smaller releases and one low flow pipe. A water supply pipe is also included but has not been used for water supply to date.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in July 2018 and classified the risk associated with Toronto Dam as low. Although extremely unlikely, the three primary risks to the integrity of the dam are: (1) A flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded and water flows over the top of the dam, (2) water seeping through the foundation of the dam leads to erosion, and (3) water seeping where the end of the embankment dam ties into bedrock leads to erosion. Failure of the dam would result in flooding in Coyville, Altoona, Neodesha, and Coffeyville, Kansas as well as rural areas along the Verdigris River. \n\nA more likely flooding scenario includes a large release through the gated spillway during a flood with the project operating as intended.   Although the inundation would not be as great as a breach of the dam, this scenario could still result in economic impacts and loss of life due to the extent of the flooding possible as part of normal operation of the dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Toronto Dam poses to communities.  Along with routine inspections and surveys, additional efforts include establishing emergency rock and sand stockpiles, emergency exercises, annual updates to the Emergency Action Plan, and development of a communication plan to communicate dam risks.  \nAdditionally, there are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Heyburn Dam in 1950 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities as well as water supply, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits.  The project consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet conduit, and an ungated spillway.  The dam is located on Polecat Creek, a tributary of the Arkansas River, about 11 miles southwest of Sapulpa in Creek County, Oklahoma, and 2 miles upstream from U.S. Highway 66 between Sapulpa and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  During large storm events the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  After the downstream river level recedes the water can be safety released into the river.  Releases are made by a drop inlet that flows into a conduit for lower lake levels and by an ungated spillway for higher lake levels and larger floods.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in June 2016 and classified the risk associated with Heyburn Dam as low.  This classification is based both on the likelihood of failure and the populations living downstream of the dam.  Although extremely unlikely, the three primary risks to the integrity of the dam are:  (1) A flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded and water flows over the top of the dam (2) Water seeping through the earthen embankment along the conduit erodes the embankment and eventually weakens the dam, and (3) A large release through the uncontrolled spillway leads to erosion and breach.  Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream, economic impacts, and significant loss of life.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the cities of Kellyville, Sapulpa, Jenks, Bixby, Muskogee, Fort Gibson, and other communities along the Arkansas River. \n\nA more likely scenario includes the potential for water to flow over the ungated spillway during a large flood as intended.  Although this flooding would be less than a breach scenario, significant economic impacts and loss of life could occur due to the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Heyburn Dam poses to the community.  There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "Detroit Dam is located on the North Santiam River 48 miles upstream the confluence with the Willamette River and 13 miles upstream of Mill City, Oregon. Detroit Dam is a 450 ft tall, 1,450 ft long concrete gravity dam, comprised of 32 monoliths, with a gated spillway with six spillway gates, four regulating outlets, and a powerhouse. Detroit Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1949 and was completed in 1953. Detroit Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, produce hydropower, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season. Detroit Dam is operated in coordination with Big Cliff Dam to achieve project objectives within the North Santiam sub basin of the Willamette River.\n\nDetroit Dam is located about 95 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. USACE completed a routine risk assessment for the Detroit Dam in May 2018 that characterizes the risk associated with the dam to be Moderate. The assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. The risk associated with Detroit Dam is primarily driven by the potential for a very large earthquake occurring at the same time summer reservoir elevations are the highest. Under these conditions, there is the potential for one or more of the spillway gates to collapse or for a structural failure of the concrete monoliths. In 2020, an updated earthquake hazard study was completed for Detroit Dam to better understand the potential amount of shaking that could occur at the site from a range of all possible earthquake fault sources. USACE has used this hazard study to review the results of the routine risk assessment and found that the amount of shaking from an extreme earthquake could be much greater at the site than originally assessed. Because of the larger predicted amount of shaking, the risks associated with the performance of the spillway gates are higher than originally assessed. Structural analysis of the spillway gates has shown there is a possibility for damage of the spillway gate\u2019s supporting arms resulting in an uncontrolled release of water from the dam. Failure of a spillway gate could cause downstream flooding and affect communities downstream of the dam. In the case of an uncontrolled release from multiple spillway gates or one or more concrete monoliths, there is potential for devastating flooding to affect large portions of the narrow river canyon areas and urban areas downstream.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The likelihood is low for an extreme earthquake to occur when the reservoir is at or near its maximum elevation, but the potential impacts of a breach of the spillway gates are very high due to the large downstream population. Therefore, immediate action is warranted to reduce risk to tolerable levels. Targeted measures (called Interim Risk Reduction Measures) were implemented in spring 2021 to reduce life-safety risk while issues are evaluated further in the Study. These measures include reducing the maximum conservation pool (the highest allowable level during summer) of Detroit reservoir by five feet to reduce the likelihood of an earthquake related failure and uncontrolled release. USACE continues to evaluate the seismic performance of the spillway and other components of the dam to determine if long-term modifications or changes to operations will be necessary. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Detroit Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Detroit Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment findings and with information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "Barker Dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1948. The dam is approximately 17 miles west of downtown Houston, Texas, and stretches 13 miles across Buffalo Bayou. Baker Dam is operated in conjunction with Addicks Dam, less than a mile away. Barker Dam is to the south of Interstate 10 and Addicks on the north of Interstate 10. Barker and Addicks dams both release into Buffalo Bayou and are in the same watershed. Together these dams reduce flood risk downstream along Buffalo Bayou and in significantly developed residential and economically critical commercial areas of Houston, including downtown.\n\nBarker Dam consists of three main structural components:  a 36 -foot tall earthen embankment, the gated water control structure, and the emergency spillways. The embankment stores water runoff in the reservoir throughout the year. The water control structure consists of three gated outlets that can release a total of approximately 8,000 cubic feet of water each second; that looks like 3.5 million gallons of water passing every minute.\n\nDuring normal operations, USACE holds water behind the embankments of both Barker and Addicks dams and then releases water through the gated outlets in a controlled manner. USACE manages the capacity of the two reservoirs to remain within 20 percent of each other to help balance the total volume of water released downstream and ensures the downstream bayou below the dam can handle the additional releases from both dams. This coordination helps keep Buffalo Bayou within its banks; reduces threats to life safety and property downstream; and, reduces the potential of flooding to the communities surrounding the reservoirs when water levels exceed the capacity for which the reservoirs were designed. \n\nThe emergency spillways at both the Barker and Addicks dams consist of concrete slabs located at each end of the dams. These spillways pass high volumes of water during extreme rainfall events -- much like the overflow holes in a sink -- to keep water from overtopping the earthen embankment.  During extreme floods like Hurricane Harvey, USACE may release water through the outlets even though streams and rivers downstream may have already reached or exceeded their capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Barker Dam significantly reduces - but does not eliminate - flood risks. Flooding can still occur in surrounding communities and watersheds. Large storm events may cause more runoff than Barker Dam can store (the most recent example of this was during Hurricane Harvey in 2017). \n\nThe reservoir can store stormwater inflow within the boundaries of the government-owned land from what is referred to as a \"43-year flood\", which means there is a 2.3-percent chance of such an event happening every year. Although larger rain events like Hurricane Harvey are less likely to occur, damage can be catastrophic during these large floods. The greater stormwater inflow could inundate larger areas, leading to higher stages, or elevation, in the reservoir and areas above government-owned land. The upstream flooding may damage and destroy buildings, roads, and bridges, and could potentially result in the loss of life.  This starts to happen when pools reach an elevation of 95 feet North American Vertical Datum 88 (NAVD*), which is before water flows around or over the emergency spillway.  Water begins to flow around and over the emergency spillways when pools reach about 104 feet NAVD 88, with peak pool levels of 109 feet NAVD 88 possible. Residents and property owners should check https://www.swg.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-Safety-Program/About-The-Reservoirs/Addicks-and-Barker-Potential-Flood-Maps/ and their home survey to evaluate their personal risk. Refer to the NID inundation maps here for additional details.\n\nIn 2013, and again in 2020, USACE completed risk assessments on the Barker Dam to determine potential threats to its ability to reduce flood risks. Assessment results classified the risk as \"high\" based on the consequences of flooding to the large populations living and working downstream of the dam in the event of dam failure and upstream in the event of extreme floods. Although it is considered extremely unlikely, a failure of the Barker Dam would include catastrophic flooding, widespread economic impacts and significant loss of life downstream.\n\nDam safety concerns identified in the 2013 risk assessment have been addressed by the construction of the new water control structure and cutoff wall completed in 2020.  The current risk at the dam is driven by the potential loss or movement of emergency spillway concrete slabs and breach of spillways at high-water elevations due to significant water pressures beneath the slabs. This increased water pressure could cause the slabs to pop up allowing water to more easily displace the slab and erode the soil beneath. \n\n*NAVD is the North American Vertical Datum. It is a point of reference on the earth used for measuring locations and elevations.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure Barker and Addicks dams can continue reducing flood risks, USACE operates the dams in accordance with a water control manual and consideration of current flow conditions, precipitation, and forecasts. USACE also coordinates operational decisions closely with the National Weather Service, Harris County Flood Control District, U.S. Geological Survey, and other agencies related to conditions both upstream and downstream of the dams. USACE updates the dams' Emergency Action Plans annually and practices emergency response efforts with state and local emergency management agencies and key stakeholders. Obtain additional information at https://www.swg.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-Safety-Program/ during extreme floods. \n\nUSACE recently constructed a new outlet structure to help reduce risks from foundation seepage and eliminate the instability of the original outlets at Barker Dam. In addition, USACE continues to rehabilitate the concrete spillways by filling in cracks and joints to reduce their risk of failing at both dams. USACE  is currently undertaking the Buffalo Bayou Resiliency and Tributary Study to evaluate potential additional actions, including those at the Barker Dam itself, to reduce flood risks upstream and downstream of Addicks and Barker dams. \n\nUSACE also regularly inspects the Barker Dam and routinely re-assesses its risk. Dam safety professionals continuously monitor both the Addicks and Barker dams during high water events and are prepared to respond if performance issues arise during any event. In the case of an emergency, USACE will communicate with local and state emergency managers, in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan, to ensure the proper precautions are taken and that notification is provided to potentially impacted communities.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Michael J Kirwan Dam in 1966 across the Mahoning River to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Mahoning, Beaver, and Ohio Rivers. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $1 billion. The reservoir also serves to store rainfall from late winter through early summer to augment flow during the drier late-summer and early-autumn months, provide water supply to downstream communities, and is used for recreational purposes.  The dam is composed of an earthen embankment that is a maximum of 83 feet high and is 2 miles long.  The reservoir levels are managed to approved levels throughout the year by means of a concrete conduit that discharges water to the downstream Mahoning River.  A concrete spillway is situated alongside the dam to release reservoir water when levels get high.  The spillway reduces the likelihood that the earthen dam could be overtopped and damaged.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Michael J Kirwan Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most recent risk assessment was completed in 2018, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as moderate.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Michael J Kirwan Dam would be an uncontrolled high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events. The frequency and amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Although this has not happened since the dam was constructed, such flooding could be similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are several other unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that could produce significant flooding if the reservoir level rises to a level higher than it has ever been: 1. the concrete spillway could collapse if the soil beneath the spillway erodes and cannot support the concrete spillway, 2. reservoir water flowing along cracks through the uppermost part of the soil embankment could erode the surrounding embankment soils, 3. water flowing along the concrete conduit could erode the surrounding soils, and 4. the dam crest and downstream embankment soils could erode if the reservoir level gets high enough and wind creates large waves that wash over the dam crest.  An extreme rainfall event would be needed to trigger any of these events.  There is uncertainty in how the dam and its spillway would perform in the events described above since the reservoir level has never been risen to the spillway level.  If any of these events were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. In Ohio, Niles, Newton Falls, Warren, and adjacent communities located in the valley below the dam are in more immediate danger in the event of a flood. Towns and cities further downstream, including Youngstown Ohio and New Castle and Beaver Falls in Pennsylvania, could experience flooding, but will also have greater warning times, should a flood occur.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, we will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plan. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with local residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current and forecasted lake levels at Pittsburgh District reservoirs are available to the public via the internet at:  \nhttps://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Portals/72/docs/WaterManagement/ResSumPlots.pdf.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Marseilles Lock and Dam was begun by the State of Illinois in 1920 but was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1933 for the purpose of navigation. Marseilles Lock and Dam is located on the Illinois River at Marseilles, Illinois. The project consists of a lock chamber, a dam, two headrace dams, and an earth dike. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 27 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 582 feet and consists of a movable Tainter gate section 582 feet in length with 8 Tainter gates and a 30 feet long concrete ice chute ogee spillway. The north headrace dam has a length of 233.1 feet and consists of a concrete fixed dam with a length of 89.1 feet and 2 Tainter gates. The south headrace dam has a length of 138.2 feet and consists of a concrete fixed dam with a length of 70.2 feet and a single Tainter gate. The earth dike extends from the north headrace dam upstream for 3,813 feet to Gum Creek. During flood events on the Illinois River, the Tainter gates at the dam are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2024 and classified the risk associated with Marseilles Lock and Dam as low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from a Tainter gate trunnion anchorage failure due to a barge impact, failure or inoperability of the Tainter gates due to a barge impact, and barges in the dam result in an overtopping of the dike. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only. An overtopping of the dike will flood the residential area behind the dike and cause substantial property damages, but depths are do not result estimated life loss.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Marseilles Lock and Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

Lock and Dam 15 is located on the Mississippi River at Rock Island, Illinois. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary lock chamber, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section. The main lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The auxiliary chamber is used to raise or lower pleasure boats and the government fleet between the upstream and downstream pools between Memorial Day and Labor Day. The lock chambers can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 16 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 1,266 feet, consisting of 11 roller-type gates. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in July 2020 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 14 as very low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from scour leading to dam instability and failure, and dam instability of the non-USACE dams due to ice, and a failure of the miter gate embedded anchorages due to fatigue. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Enid Dam in 1952 and continues to own, operate, and maintain the facility today. Located on the Yocona River about 12 miles south of Batesville, Mississippi, Enid Dam is one of four Yazoo Headwater Projects authorized to reduce flood risks throughout the Yazoo River Basin. The dam also supports water supply, water quality control, irrigation, fish and wildlife management, and recreational use for the surrounding region.\n\nThe rolled-earth embankment dam stands 103 feet tall and spans approximately 8,400 feet in length. Enid Lake, the reservoir created by the dam, has a storage capacity of over 1.5 million acre-feet. Water is released through two 11-foot diameter conduits, regulated by large gates located in the intake tower. These gates can release a combined maximum of 9,400 cubic feet of water per second, which would fill up an Olympic sized swimming pool in 10 seconds. An uncontrolled, broad-crested weir spillway with a capacity of nearly 50,000 cfs, which is enough flow to fill an Olympic sized swimming pool in 1.8 seconds, is located at the northern end of the dam to safely pass excess water during major flood events.\nEnid Dam is managed year-round to balance flood control and recreational use. Water levels are reduced during the fall and winter to provide storage capacity for potential storm runoff and are raised during spring and summer for public recreation. These operations follow the congressionally authorized Water Control Plan for the Yazoo Basin.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Enid Dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding for downstream communities like Crowder and Greenwood, Mississippi, it cannot eliminate flood risk entirely. Extremely rare but possible storm scenarios could produce more rainfall than the dam is designed to store, potentially causing the reservoir to rise to dangerous levels.\n\nUSACE\u2019s latest Periodic Assessment, completed in 2023, evaluated the dam\u2019s performance during extreme events and identified two primary potential failure modes: overtopping of the dam during an extreme flood, and backward erosion piping (BEP) through the foundation near the outlet works.\n\nOvertopping could occur during a rare storm that pushes water levels above the dam crest, leading to erosion and breach of the embankment. The likelihood of such a failure is estimated to be very unlikely, with potential life loss if it occurs. Intervention is unlikely due to the difficulty of quickly raising or protecting more than 8,000 feet of dam embankment during an emergency.\n\nBreach through foundation could result from excessive uplift pressures and seepage through erodible foundation sands, leading to a piping failure. Relief wells have been installed to control these pressures, but aging infrastructure and unknown conditions in old wood stave wells introduce uncertainty. \n\nNon-breach risks\u2014flooding from high spillway releases without dam failure\u2014were also analyzed. While these floods do not involve dam failure, they could still inundate downstream areas and result in economic losses up to $100 million and minor loss of life.\n\nIf Enid Dam were to breach, floodwaters would rapidly impact low-lying areas in Panola County and downstream along the Yocona and Yazoo Rivers. Deep, fast-moving water could cause widespread damage to homes, infrastructure, and agriculture. Although such a failure is unlikely, USACE remains in communication with the National Weather Service (NWS) and local emergency officials to ensure communities receive timely warnings and evacuation instructions during high water events.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To reduce risk and enhance public safety, USACE has implemented several ongoing measures at Enid Dam. These include updating the Emergency Action Plan (EAP), improving risk communication with downstream communities, and increasing coordination with local Emergency Management Agencies. Routine inspections, training, and dam safety evaluations are conducted on a recurring basis. \n\nRelief wells, essential for controlling foundation seepage pressures, are maintained on a five-year treatment schedule. Additional piezometers are being installed to monitor critical areas, especially near historic sand boil sites. \nAlthough Enid Dam is currently rated as a DSAC 4\u2014indicating low urgency\u2014the Corps continues to manage it with care, ensuring the dam remains safe, reliable, and capable of performing its authorized functions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Albeni Falls Dam in August 2016 to determine potential threats to USACE\u2019s ability to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low. One unlikely failure scenario analyzed involves a severe earthquake damaging the spillway, causing an uncontrolled release of water downstream. Another potential failure scenario involving malfunction of the crane used to operate the spillway gates during a major flood event could also result in an uncontrolled release of water downstream if the gates overtopped and failed. Although these failure scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, USACE maintains an Albeni Falls Dam Emergency Action Plan to lower the risk of life loss and property damage if any of these scenarios occurred.\n\nUSACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate flooding. Extreme snowmelt and rainfall events require USACE to release rising water through the dam\u2019s spillway to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam and to balance flood risk to Lake Pend Oreille. This can result in flooding areas downstream.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to ensure risks to life safety and property remain low. USACE conducts regular inspections to monitor the health of the dam. The frequency of inspections increases when conditions change to confirm whether the structure is performing as designed and identify areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Rainfall and snowpack forecasts are continuously monitored to determine when high water flow events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood operations and associated warnings. USACE also works closely with local emergency managers to annually update the Emergency Action Plan, conducts periodic emergency exercises with state and local response teams, and annually hosts water control information stakeholder meetings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. Locks and Dam 24 is located on the Mississippi River adjacent to Clarksville, Missouri, 93.5 river miles upstream from St. Louis and 273.5 miles upstream from the mouth of the Ohio River. The dam and 600-foot main lock were authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Act, 3 July 1930, Rivers and Harbors Commission Document No. 12, 70th Congress, First Session. Lock and Dam 24 was authorized as part of the navigation project to provide a 9-foot deep by 300-foot minimum width channel on the upper Mississippi River between the mouth of the Missouri River and Minneapolis, Minnesota. The project was placed in operation on 12 March 1940. The project consists of a dam structure with 15 Tainter gates, 600-foot lock, partial auxiliary lock to be completed in the future, and an overflow dike that ties into the Sny Island Levee and Drainage District.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Mississippi River Lock and Dam 24 is currently categorized as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4, which is considered low urgency in that there is low incremental risk. Inundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood, the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.  \nFor this navigation project, failure is defined as the inability to maintain navigation services or preserve the 9-foot channel. Three risk driving failure modes were determined from the previous risk assessment. Two of the failure modes were related to fatigue  from years of service and the third was due to conditions beyond the project\u2019s control . Since the risk assessment, one of the fatigue failure modes has been permanently repaired and operations have been adjusted to prevent further degradation of the other.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce the risk of malfunction and loss of services through risk-based decision making, enterprise lessons learned, and routine inspections. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to verify the health of the structure, including conducting underwater surveys upstream, downstream, and around the project to monitor for changing conditions. The frequency of data collection and inspection increases when the hazards change, which includes hydraulic loading, seismicity, events caused by human error, and is prioritized in accordance with the risk assessment. This ensures that the structure operates as intended, enabling the detection of any potential issues, which allows USACE to address them proactively before they impact services. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the project functioning properly. Although all risk cannot be eliminated, USACE works closely with local emergency managers to regularly update the Emergency Action Plan and conduct emergency exercises with state and local response teams to ensure preparedness in the event of an emergency.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Clinton Dam in 1975. Clinton Dam is located on the Wakarusa River at roughly mile 22.2 in Douglas County, Kansas. The Dam is located on the southwest boundary of the city of Lawrence, Kansas. Downstream of the dam is the City of Lawrence located approximately 6 miles downstream. The dam was authorized for flood control, water conservation, recreation, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Clinton Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $1.8 billion (2023 price level) from 1977 to 2021. The dam is a rolled earth embankment approximately 9,250 feet long and has a maximum height of approximately 114 feet above the Wakarusa River bed with a controlled outlet works and an uncontrolled spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Clinton Dam was well constructed and is well maintained. Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario that will result in downstream flooding from Clinton Dam is spillway discharge during a large and intense storm event. While this is the most likely event to cause downstream flooding it is still rare. In the extremely rare event where the uncontrolled spillway is used, erosion may occur in the spillway cutting down deeper in the reservoir leading to more water flowing out further exacerbating the downstream flooding. \n\nA far less likely, but more devasting scenario exists: an extreme rainfall event that results in water flowing over the earthen embankment, eroding the embankment and leading to a breach releasing a vast amount of water in a short time. Although such a precipitation event is extremely rare, it is a possibility.  \n\nIn either of these scenarios, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities including Lawrence, KS.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high reservoir levels. Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high reservoir level is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "Blue River Dam is located on the McKenzie River 1.5 miles upstream of Blue River, Oregon, and 41 miles upstream of Eugene and Springfield, Oregon. Blue River Dam is a 270-foot tall, 1,250-foot-long rockfill earthen embankment dam with a concrete spillway, two spillway gates, an intake structure with regulating outlet, and a 72-foot tall, 1,535-foot-long gravel earthen saddle dam. Blue River Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1965 and was completed in 1968. The authorized purposes of the project are flood risk management, hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, navigation, and water quality. \n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount of storage available for flood risk management.  During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season. Blue River Dam is downstream of Cougar Dam. \n\nBlue River Dam is located about 95 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone can produce very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE has been conducting advanced risk assessments, called Issue Evaluation Studies (IES), at several Willamette Valley Project dams including Blue River Dam. The IES for Blue River Dam began in the spring of 2021 and is currently underway. As of June 2021, results of the advanced study for Blue River Dam identified the risk associated with the dam to be High. The risk is driven by two primary factors: the high population downstream combined with the potential for an extreme earthquake occurring at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest.  Under these conditions, the main earthen dam and saddle dam could settle and crack, resulting in water overtopping and flowing through the dams. It is difficult to predict the exact amount of settlement and cracking that could occur due to such an earthquake. The speed and depth of water flowing over and through the damaged dams could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam and cause significant flooding downstream. The shaking from an extreme earthquake could also cause the concrete spillway to become damaged. If this occurs when the reservoir is at its highest, the cracked and damaged spillway may no longer be able to hold back water. The study also determined that an extreme and unlikely rainfall event could cause significant downstream flooding by overtopping the dam. Fallen trees, woody debris, and rockfall debris in the reservoir could partially block the spillway gates during an extreme and unlikely rainfall event. The partial blockage of the spillway gates from the debris could reduce or prevent passage of flow through the dam, which would cause the reservoir to rise above and flow over the top of the embankment dam. As water flows over the top of the dam, the speed and depth of the water could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam. Because Blue River Dam is located upstream of Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, there is potential for devastating flooding to affect large downstream populations in urban areas and surrounding suburbs, as well as rural communities in the floodplain and narrow canyons. \n\nUSACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. The assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams.  Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to evaluate the seismic performance of the embankments and the spillway as part of the IES to determine if immediate short-term measures or long-term modifications will be necessary. The IES work will include sampling and testing of the earthen embankment materials and advanced computer modeling of the earthen and concrete structures that will simulate the response to earthquake shaking.  USACE is also working to remove fire-damaged trees and rockfall from the September 2020 wildfire that devastated much of the McKenzie River Valley. Removal of this material from around the reservoir and spillway channel will reduce the likelihood of reduced flow capacity through the spillway. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Blue River Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Blue River Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on the ongoing risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Kaw Dam in 1976 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Kaw Dam is located between Kay County and Osage County, on the Arkansas River about 7 miles east of Ponca City, Oklahoma.   During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  After the storm passes and the river level recedes, the water can be safety released into the river.  Water storage and releases are managed by a large gated spillway.  This spillway is flanked on each side by concrete dam sections and earthen embankments.  The project also includes a hydroelectric power plant operated by Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA) that began operating in 1989 that generates power for the community.  In addition to the power generated at the dam itself, the project provides water supply for the Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) power plant located downstream along the Arkansas River.  Kaw Dam also provides water supply, water quality control, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in November 2014 and classified the risk associated with Kaw Dam as low.  Although extremely unlikely, the three primary risks to the integrity of the dam are related to the potential for water seeping through the sandy foundation beneath the embankment dam  leading to erosion and breach.  Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream, economic impacts, and loss of life.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the cities of Ponca City, Cleveland, Sand Springs, Tulsa, Jenks, and Bixby, and other communities along the Arkansas River. \n\nA more likely flooding scenario includes a large release through the gated spillway during a flood with the project operating as intended.   Although the inundation would not be as great as a breach of the dam, this scenario could still result in widespread economic impacts and loss of life due to the extent of the flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Kaw Dam poses to the community.  There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance (O&M) activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Tygart Dam across the Tygart River in 1938 to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in the low-lying communities in the Tygart and Monongahela River valleys, including Grafton, Colfax, Kingmont, Pleasant Valley, Fairmont, and Morgantown, West Virginia  and Brownsville, Pennsylvania. The dam is located about two miles upstream of Grafton, West Virginia and forms the Tygart Lake.  Tygart Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $1.3 billion since the start of operations. The reservoir stores rainfall to maintain downstream flow within the downstream riverbanks and releases water after flood events; provides water to the city of Grafton, West Virginia; and provides numerous opportunities for recreation.  The Tygart Dam releases additional water downstream during the drier summer and fall months to meet navigation water supply requirements on the Monongahela and upper Ohio Rivers for commercial navigation.  Tygart Dam is a concrete dam and has a maximum height of 234 feet and a length of  1921 feet.  The dam has a 489-foot-long spillway, designed to release a large volume of water during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for the Tygart Dam was completed in 2017, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as very low.  The dam was well-constructed and is well-maintained.  However, large populations live downstream of Tygart Dam, including those in Grafton, Colfax, Kingmont, Pleasant Valley, Fairmont, and Morgantown, West Virginia;  Brownsville, Pennsylvania; and other low-lying communities in the Tygart and Monongahela River valleys. Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding to these communities, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from Tygart Dam would be a high-volume release over the dam\u2019s spillway (during an unusually large and intense storm event).  The spillway has never experienced flow since the project was put into full operation in 1938.  Water released over the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam had not been constructed.  \n\nThere is another unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding: drains in the foundation of the concrete dam could become plugged, increasing the pressure at the foundation of the dam, and leading to monolith movement during high pool conditions.  \n\nIn either scenario, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Communities, including Grafton, that are closer to the dam, are in more immediate danger of a significant flood event and may have little advanced warning.  Cities and communities further downstream of the dam, such as Fairmont and Morgantown, have larger populations and possibly less awareness of the dam but will have more warning. \n\nWith either of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, possibly overflowing banks on the Tygart and Monongahela Rivers, destroying buildings and infrastructure.  Anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plans. We will study whether there are additional measures that we can take to reduce the risk associated with high reservoir levels and uplift pressures resulting in monolith movement.  We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently during high-water events.  Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high-water event is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses.  We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.  In partnership with the U.S. Geologic Survey information on current lake levels at the Tygart reservoir is available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttps://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/03055500/#dataTypeId=continuous-00045-0&period=P7D&showMedian=true",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Newt Graham Lock and Dam 18 in 1970 for the primary purpose of navigation.  The dam also provides recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits.  Newt Graham Lock and Dam is located 8 miles southwest of Inola, OK, on the Verdigris River, a Tributary to the Arkansas River.  \nThe project consists of earth embankments, a concrete spillway with gates, and a navigation lock.  Under normal river conditions, the flows within the river are regulated by the concrete gated spillway to ensure river levels are high enough for navigation barge traffic.  During river flooding, the spillway gates are fully opened to allow as much water to pass through the structure as possible.  After the flood passes and the river level recedes, the project returns to normal river conditions.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Newt Graham Lock and Dam in 2020 and classified the risk as low.  The risk is primarily driver by the potential for the spillway gates to fail leading to loss of navigation pool and inability to pass barge traffic.  Other items that contributed to the risk include the potential for erosion along the embankment spillway contact as well as the potential for a barge to strike a spillway gate.  Failure of the dam would include a disruption to navigation and economic impacts.  Widespread flooding could occur downstream as part of normal operation of the dam (when the gates are fully opened during a large flood). A large increase in downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail as the dam is not designed or operated to reduce downstream flooding, but instead for navigation purposes.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk that Newt Graham Lock and Dam poses to downstream communities and those that rely on river navigation. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal river levels and during and after flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has an instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.  Lastly, the navigation lock chamber is periodically dewatered for inspection and repairs.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Broken Bow Dam in 1970 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Broken Bow Dam is located on the Mountain Fork River, about 9 miles northeast of the town of Broken Bow, OK.  During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  After the storm passes and the Mountain Fork River level recedes, the water can be safety released into the river.  Water storage and releases are managed by a gated spillway.  The project also includes a hydroelectric power plant that began operating in 1970 that generates power for the community.  In addition, the water held back by the dam forms a reservoir providing recreation benefits.  Broken Bow Dam is also used for water supply purposes and fish and wildlife conservation.  Associated with the dam is also a reregulation dam, located 5 miles downstream of the powerhouse, and two dikes located just north of the dam.  The reregulation dam satisfies the low flow requirements of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and smooths fluctuations caused by the powerhouse releases.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in August 2017 and classified the risk associated with Broken Bow Dam as low.  The risk is primarily driven by the potential for water seeping through rock fractures in the foundation beneath the dam which could lead to embankment erosion and breach.  Other issues identified includes the remote potential for the same issue to occur but through the dike embankment or for water to flow over the gated spillway causing erosion that eventually downstream that weakens the spillway.  Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream resulting in loss of life and economic impacts.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the unincorporated community of Eagletown, OK.  There is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation of the dam which could include large releases through the gated spillway during a large flood.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no estimated potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Lock & Dam 10 in 1937.  The project is located on the Mississippi River in Guttenberg, Iowa. USACE operates Lock & Dam 10 primarily for navigation purposes, but congress also authorized USACE to make recreation improvements associated with the pool formed above the dam. Additionally, environmental management on the river is coordinated with the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources, and other state & federal agencies. The main components of the project include a lock, a gated spillway structure with 4 roller gates and 8 Tainter gates, an overflow weir, and 0.9 miles of earthen embankments connecting these other components. The embankment has a crest elevation of 623.4 feet (NAVD 88) and a maximum height of 28 feet.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Lock & Dam 10 is a run-of-river dam that maintains a navigation pool for river traffic but does not store flood waters. The gated spillway is regulated to hold a constant pool level for navigation purposes at elevation 610.4 up to river flows of 78,000 cfs.  The 78,000 cfs flow is exceeded about 15% of the time and occurs most years (generally in the spring).  Above this flow, the gates are fully opened, and the dam has less than one foot of impact on the river stages. The maximum water level differential across the dam is 8 feet and occurs at low river flows.  Based upon a risk assessment in 2015, USACE considers Lock & Dam 10 to be a low-risk dam among its more than 700 dams. Identified risks are primarily due to aging miter gates in the locks, and potential for navigation accidents.  Other risks include the failure of the earth dam due to overtopping.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.   Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Other hazards exist, such as swimming and boat safety in the vicinity of the dam.  USACE regularly engages the public to raise awareness of the dam; and coordinates with state and county emergency managers (particularly during river flood events).",

    "riskCharSummary": "The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities; however, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Although Senecaville Dam has historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event.  An event such as this could require unusually large quantities of water to be released. \n\nA 2016 risk assessment for Senecaville Dam classified the risk of failure for the entire project system as low.  The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the uncontrolled and controlled sections of the concrete spillway (located in the central part of the dam) has the potential to pass up to 10,400 cubic feet of water per second.   The spillway is designed to pass water to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.\n\nWhile the Senecaville Dam spillway has never flowed.  If operated, it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from the dam to Cambridge, OH.  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along Seneca Fork and Wills Creek, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows.  Although the odds of such a storm even occurring are considered extremely unlikely, Senecaville Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any unanticipated scenarios were to occur.   \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach high elevations quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Senecaville Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Senecaville Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions, and flood fighting materials are stored onsite in case of an emergency.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Birch Dam in 1977 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Birch Dam is located on Birch Creek about 2 miles south of Barnsdall, OK. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream for communities along the Arkansas River.  This stored water can then be released in a more controlled manner to reduce dangerous flooding.  These releases are regulated by a discharge conduit through the earthen dam. For large flood events, an ungated spillway is located north of the gate tower which allows additional storage release to help prevent dam overtopping. Birch Dam also was constructed to provide water supply, water quality monitoring, fish and wildlife habitats, and recreation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2020 and classified the risk associated with Birch Dam as low. While the dam was noted to be in good condition during the assessment, the primary risk identified to the dam is the potential for water to flow over the top of the dam during an extreme flood resulting in erosion in breach.  The assessment also identified a remote risk associated with the potential for water seeping through the earth foundation beneath the dam to result in soil erosion and breach.  In the remote event of dam failure there would be catastrophic flooding downstream, widespread economic impacts, and significant loss of life. The largest impacts would be to the cities of Barnsdall, Avant, Skiatook, Owasso, Tulsa, and other communities along the Arkansas River. Key infrastructure along the river from Barnsdall to Webbers Falls could also be damaged or destroyed, including operation and access of the Kerr-McClellan Navigational System.\n\nThere is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation of the dam which could include large releases through the ungated spillway during a large flood.  While this flooding would be less than a breach scenario it could still result in economic impacts and loss of life due to the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk Birch Dam poses to downstream communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. These instruments are monitored regularly for any early indications of potential safety concerns at the project.",

    "projectDescription": "The Dover Dam and Levees (Corundite, Fairfield, Somerdale, U.S. Brick-Norton Chemical) Project is one of a system of projects designed to provide flood control, recreation, water conservation and fish and wildlife enhancement in the Muskingum Watershed in north central Ohio. The dam was built with the original system of 14 reservoir projects in the Muskingum River Basin in cooperation with the Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District. The contract for construction of the dam was award with a notice to proceed in May 1935 and construction was complete in November 1937. \n\nDover Dam has six upstream appurtenant levees which provide a barrier to the upstream communities or businesses which would otherwise be flooded by the pool created behind the dam. Those levees are the Zoar Levee, Zoar Diversion Dam, Somerdale Levee, Corundite Levee, US Brick (Norton Chemical) Levee, and Fairfield Levee. Zoar Levee protects the historic town of Zoar, Ohio, which is located four miles north of the dam. The Zoar Diversion Dam is at the same location as Zoar Levee. Somerdale Levee is located about three miles east of Dover Dam. Corundite Levee is located about 4 miles northwest of the dam. US Brick (Norton Chemical) Levee is located about 4.5 miles northeast of the dam. Fairfield Levee is located about two miles northeast of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dover dam and levees significantly reduce the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, they do not entirely eliminate risk. Although Dover Dam has historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream and leveed areas to be flooded. Even when the dam and levees operate as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event. This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillway. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Dover Dam in 2016 and classified the risk associated with failure as low. This risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely. During such an event, the spillways have the potential to pass over 123,000 cubic feet of water per second. The operation of the spillway would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.\n\nWhile the Dover Dam spillway has never seen flow, if operated it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Dover, OH to New Philadelphia, OH. Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, gas, and water supply may occur. Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along the Tuscarawas, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows. \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach hillside to hillside quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location. In the unlikely event Dover Dam must pass these extreme waters, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Dover Dam, Zoar Levee, Somerdale Levee, Fairfield Levee, Norton Chemical Levee, and Corundite Levee. The project is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam and levees during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Harry S. Truman Dam, completing in 1979. Truman Dam is located on the Osage River at roughly mile 175 in Benton County, Missouri, about 1-1/2 miles northwest of Warsaw, Missouri. Downstream of the dam is Warsaw, Missouri, Bagnell Dam, and Lake of the Ozarks. The dam was authorized for flood control, hydroelectric power, water supply, recreation, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Truman Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $3.7 billion (2017 price level) from 1981 to 2016. The dam is 5,100 feet long of which 4,100 feet is compacted earth and rock fill embankment and the rest is composed of concrete structures including a powerhouse, spillway and non-overflow sections.  Additionally, four appurtenant structures including three rim dikes and the Sterett Creek Dike along US Highway 65 complete the reservoir rim.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Harry S. Truman Dam in November 2022 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low. If an extreme flood event occurs, inflows into the reservoir may exceed than the storage and release capacity of the dam, and overtopping may occur. If overtopping occurs the earthen embankment portion of dam could erode leading to a sudden release of water downstream. This would result in deadly flooding in Warsaw, Missouri and high inflows into Lake of the Ozarks causing damage to Bagnell Dam leading to further flooding at downstream communities along the Osage and Missouri Rivers including St. Louis, Missouri. \n\nUSACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed the Truman Lake storage capacity require USACE to release water through spillway gates to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam. This can result in flooding at downstream areas.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nUSACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Almond Dam in 1949 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on Canacadea Creek in Steuben County, NY, approximately three miles upstream of the confluence with the Canisteo River in Hornell, NY.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Almond Lake which provides recreation benefits.  Releases are made by gates which discharge flow through a conduit in the abutment of the dam.  The project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Almond Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to Canacadea Creek.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Hornell, Canisteo and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Canacadea Creek and Canisteo River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Almond Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be very low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no estimated potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Canyon Lake Dam on the Guadalupe River in the early 1960\u2019s to reduce the risk of flooding to the downstream Texas cities of New Braunfels, Seguin, Gonzalez, Victoria, and adjacent towns and counties. Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam also provides significant water supply to nearby communities and offers unique recreational opportunities, along with fish and wildlife conservation and non- federal hydroelectric power generation. These benefits all significantly improve the quality of life in the area. Canyon Lake Dam is located 12 miles northwest of New Braunfels, Texas on the Guadalupe River. Canyon Lake Dam consists of an earthen embankment that holds water in the reservoir, gates that are operated to control water releases at the dam, and a spillway, which allows water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir become high. The main dam is made up of soil and rock and is 200 feet (or 20 stories) high near its center. Soil and rock dikes located south of the spillway and southwest of the dam near the Skyline Boat Ramp fill in low areas around the reservoir rim. Except for variations due to hydropower generation, water supply or flood storage, the reservoir is operated year-round as close to the top of the conservation (or normal) pool which is at a 909-foot elevation. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir until the swollen streams and rivers below the dam recede and can handle the release of stored water without damage to lives, property or the environment. Sometimes water must be released to protect the dam\u2019s integrity even though these streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Even though Canyon Lake Dam reduces the risk of flooding to the downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. USACE Fort Worth District completed a risk assessment for Canyon Lake Dam in May 2020 that characterizes the risk associated with the project as high, primarily due to the large populations living downstream that could be flooded under potential failure scenarios. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Canyon Lake Dam would-be high-volume releases through the overflow spillway during significant storm events. Such high releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist. Although Canyon Lake Dam has historically performed well and safely passed the record 2002 flood event through the spillway, extreme rainfall events may result in up to an additional 25 feet of water over the spillway than what took place during the 2002 event. A spillway event of this magnitude would impact critical infrastructure downstream and has the potential to result in loss of life in communities such as New Braunfels and Seguin. The most devastating scenario, but significantly less likely to happen, would occur if the main dam or dikes were to be overtopped by stored water during an extreme flood event, in which case erosion of the embankment and breach of the dam could be possible. Should such a breach occur, significant depths of flooding up to four stories (approximately 40 feet) would be experienced down the Guadalupe River in New Braunfels and Seguin with lesser impacts further downstream. Although these communities have well-practiced emergency action plans and local emergency managers meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, including the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes; regularly updating the Canyon Lake Dam Emergency Action Plan; and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as stockpiling materials to help lessen the potential for overtopping. USACE maintains road surfaces and turf on the dam to provide some erosion resistance should water flow over the dam. Fort Worth District regularly inspects and monitors instruments that help ensure that the structure is performing as intended and help detect potential concerns. The frequency of these dam inspections increases when the lake level rises and will be held weekly, daily, or hourly to assess flow and sediment transport if necessary. Critical operation procedures, hydraulic steel structure and periodic inspections, and periodic assessments are held on an annual, five year, and ten-year basis respectively. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Mansfield Hollow Dam in 2011 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Low. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Mansfield Hollow Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist. \n\nThere are also six unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would result in failure of the dam or dike B and downstream flooding:  The most likely, but still \"moderate\" is the sliding failure of a spillway monolith.  Overtopping of the dam, toe drains plugging or being damages are the other risk drivers at the dam, with low likelihoods of occurrence.  At Dike B, the risk driving failure modes are foundation erosion and erosion along the conduit.  Were any of these events to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. It should be noted that a new Periodic Assessment is currently being conducted, and will be based on current guidance and understanding of risk drivers.   Mansfield, Windham, Scotland, Sprague, Norwich, Lisbon, and Preston, CT are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities further downstream would also be impacted, but less so. \n\nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "Baldhill Dam is located about 8 miles northwest of Valley City, North Dakota, in Barnes County on the Sheyenne River. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in cooperation with the North Dakota State Water Commission, constructed Baldhill Dam (Lake Ashtabula) between 1947 and 1950.  The dam alleviates water shortages in municipal and rural areas along the Sheyenne River and the Red River of the North by storing water in the reservoir, and supplements low flows to improve water quality. The dam reduces flood risk primarily at Valley City, but benefits downstream communities as well, including Kathryn, Fort Ransom, and Lisbon. Lake Ashtabula provides various recreational opportunities and environmental stewardship activities. The dam includes a large compacted earth embankment, a gated outlet structure used to regulate the reservoir levels, and an 880-foot wide emergency spillway that is the prominent concrete paving visible on the downstream face of the embankment. In 2004, new Tainter gates were installed and easements adjusted to increase the storage capacity of the reservoir.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Baldhill Dam in 2014 that characterized the risk associated with the project as Low. However, the dam does not completely eliminate flood risk in the Sheyenne River.   By using weather and stream-flow forecasting, the dam is operated to reduce flood risk downstream by storing the peak river flows during each event.  However, large enough storms could fill the reservoir to its capacity (up to the crest of the 880-foot wide concrete spillway), at which point additional flows must pass through the spillway, and could be  large enough to overtop levees downstream.  Storm events in the future could exceed previous records. In recent years, regions of North Dakota have experienced large and intense spring storms, requiring higher releases from the dam which can flood Valley City and other communities downstream. Flood events may occur throughout the year, particularly during spring snowmelt and summer storms.  \n\nValley City and communities downstream on the Sheyenne River historically have benefited from the flood risk management provided by the dam most frequently during spring snowmelt.  In the future, the flood season could extend through summer, and floods could be far more severe than previously experienced.  During floods extreme enough to overtop riverbanks and levees, significant amounts of water passed through the dam could reach Valley City in less than 6 hours.  This means residents of Valley City would have limited time to evacuate and there is a potential for life loss during catastrophic flood events. Valley City would also have areas of higher depth and faster moving water than is common in the Red River Valley.\n\nOne very unlikely aspect of the risk is observed movement of the hillside northwest of the gated spillway.  Land movement, which is very common in this region, has been observed since the dam was constructed but is judged to be stable at this time.  Future acceleration of the movement could interfere with operation of the gates and could potentially justify reduction of the flood storage capacity.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continually taking steps to manage the risks to the public.  Weather and streamflow forecast information is critical for operating the dam most effectively.  The Corps of Engineers works closely with the National Weather Service to share real-time data and river models. This information is used to minimize any flooding impacts to downstream communities.   \n\nThe Valley City Levees and related infrastructure have been improved and raised by the local community.  These modifications increased the amount of water the downstream river can hold, which means more water can be released from the reservoir without causing damages downstream.  This has improved the effectiveness of the overall flood risk management system. \n\nLandslide movements on the west hillside are continually monitored using buried devices that measure earth movement and groundwater levels. Countermeasures to slow the movement have been installed several times; and additional measures will be taken if the landslide continues to expand.",

    "projectDescription": "Eau Galle Dam is a flood risk management dam located in Pierce County, Wisconsin (about 50 miles east of St. Paul, Minnesota). The dam is immediately upstream of the Village of Spring Valley, Wisconsin. The dam was constructed under the authority of the Flood Control Act of 1944 (Public Law 78-534). The reservoir outlet is ungated with a morning glory intake and conduit that runs along the left abutment. The size of the conduit limits outflows within the downstream channel capacity.  There is an emergency spillway notched in the rock on the right abutment to prevent dam overtopping for extreme floods, but the frequency of such events is extremely rare (estimated recurrence about 5000 years).",
    "riskCharSummary": "A risk assessment in 2020 concluded the dam is well constructed with modern design criteria.  The risk assessment investigated three potential failure modes that included embankment overtopping, concentrated leak erosion along the conduit, and concentrated leak erosion in rock joint sets in the right abutment.  All three failure modes were determined to be very remote. The risk assessment also updated inundation mapping which shows a very high life safety hazard since Spring Valley is in a valley immediately downstream of the dam. The dam safety risk was categorized as low (relative to the Corps 700 dams) and tolerable.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To manage dam safety risks, USACE has a routine program that inspects and monitors its dams regularly and implements short- and long-term actions on a prioritized basis when unacceptable risks are found at any of its dams. The Corps maintains instrumentation on the dam and periodically makes assessments to verify the dam\u2019s performance.  A dam failure warning system has been considered because of the quick response of the reservoir to rainfall and considering consequences that would be incurred by activation of the emergency spillway; but the frequency and anticipated situational awareness during such events did not justify the maintenance.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of El Dorado Dam in 1981 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities as well as water quality, water supply, fish and wildlife, and recreation.  El Dorado Dam is located on the Walnut River in southeastern Kansas in Butler County on the northeast edge of El Dorado, Kansas.  The dam consists of an earth fill embankment, a gated outlet works, and an uncontrolled spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for El Dorado Dam in 2015 and classified the risk associated with the dam as low. The risk is driven primarily by the potential for water flowing through foundation rock to result in erosion of the overlying embankment.  While the chance of failure occurring is remote it would result in downstream flooding, loss of life, and economic impacts. In the event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the towns of El Dorado and Augusta, Kansas. Levees in the cities of Augusta, Winfield, and Arkansas City would be overtopped for a breach at maximum pool.  \nThere are also operational risks associated with planned releases for a flood event.  There would be advanced warning for a large flood of this magnitude.  Spillway releases would not overtop the levees in Augusta, Winfield, and Arkansas City but some life loss would still be likely to occur given the degree of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts to help manage the risk that El Dorado Dam poses to downstream communities. These include conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Cave Run Dam in 1973. Cave Run Dam is located on the Licking River in Rowan and Bath Counties, 173.6 miles above its confluence with the Ohio River, and 4 miles upstream of Farmers, Kentucky. The project is about 84 miles southeast of Cincinnati, Ohio and about 118 miles east of  Louisville, Kentucky. The primary purposes of the project are flood risk management, water supply, and recreation. Cave Run reservoir also provides water to a fish hatchery downstream from the dam. The Cave Run project consists of a 2,700-foot-long earth and rock filled embankment dam with a maximum height of 148 feet, a gate-controlled outlet works, and an uncontrolled spillway with an average width of 650 feet through the left abutment. The project has a drainage area of approximately 826 square miles and reduces flooding along the Licking River to its confluence with the Ohio River. The record pool elevation of 760.6 ft-NAVD88 occurred in April of 2015 which resulted in high releases from the dam\u2019s outlet but no discharge from the spillway (El. 764.5 ft-NAVD88).",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Cave Run in October 2018 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 5 which is considered Very Low relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not eliminate the risk completely. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to flow through the dam spillway, resulting in unusually large quantities of water being discharged. There is also a very unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is internal erosion of the dam\u2019s earthen embankment during a period of high reservoir levels leading to a breach of the dam. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along the Licking River.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream areas. The largest impacts would be to communities located along the Licking River. These communities include Farmers, Salt Lick, Falmouth, and Butler, Kentucky. Flooding would also impact many local roadways including evacuation routes.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast, and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather Service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. Operation of the dam\u2019s outlet works are then adjusted accordingly to minimize impacts downstream. USACE regularly monitors on-site instruments and conducts regular inspections to ensure the health and integrity of the dam. The frequency of these inspections increases when the lake level rises. This ensures the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The John Martin Dam project is owned and operated by the Albuquerque District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The project includes a dam located on the Arkansas River in Bent County, Colorado, about midway between the communities of Las Animas and Lamar, and 58 miles upstream from the Kansas state line.  Construction was completed in 1948 and primary project features include a combination zoned earthen embankment and concrete gravity dam; gated outlet works to adjust operational water releases into the Arkansas River; and spillway.  The spillway is integral to the concrete gravity dam and gated to allow large operational water releases.  The project also includes Fort Lyon Protective Works, an earthen embankment located upstream of the dam to reduce flood risk at the Fort during periods of high lake levels.  During flood events, the John Martin Dam project can be operated for flood risk reduction on its own or in conjunction with other dams to optimize upstream and downstream flood risk reduction throughout the Arkansas River Basin.  In addition to the project\u2019s main purpose of flood risk reduction, it is authorized for irrigation benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although the John Martin Dam project has successfully reduced flooding, it does not eliminate all flood risk caused by rain downstream of the dam or due to emergency operation of the project.  During infrequent flood or emergency operations, larger required releases passing through the project\u2019s gated outlet works, or gated spillway, would surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Arkansas River to Kaw Dam.  Much larger spillway flow could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Arkansas River, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by large spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Arkansas River to Kaw Dam.  Impacted communities include Lamar (right figure) and Holly, Colorado, and through Kansas including Syracuse, Lakin, Holcomb, Garden City, Cimarron, Dodge City, Kinsley (left figure), Great Bend, Larnad, and Wichita, and towns located in between.\n\nA risk assessment of the John Martin Dam project was conducted by USACE in 2021.  Preliminary results characterized dam breach risk as HIGH due to the combination of unacceptable life-risk and potential high likelihood of a dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the consequence of an extreme event.  Specifically, the occurrence of dam breach caused by instability of the concrete dam during higher pools that can occur during normal operation was identified.  Although the annual probability of dam breach due to instability of the concrete dam is estimated to be low (1 in 1,000,000), it could be moderate (1 in 10,000) if project features have deteriorated since construction.  In addition, dam breach caused by overtopping erosion as the consequence of a rare storm event (1 in 17,000 years or 0.006% per year) was identified and the annual probability of dam breach caused by the occurrence is estimated to be moderate (1 in 10,000).  Flood inundation caused by dam breach would be life-threatening with catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Arkansas River to Kaw Dam.  Impacted communities include Lamar (right figure) and Holly, Colorado, and through Kansas including Syracuse, Lakin, Holcomb, Garden City, Cimarron, Dodge City, Kinsley (left figure), Great Bend, Larnad, and Wichita, and towns located in between.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquake or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  An Issue Evaluation Study is underway to assess dam breach risk and includes investigation of project features; evaluation of stability and hydrologic loading; and installation of additional instruments to improve performance monitoring.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities include cleaning and rehabilitation of the stilling basin, outlet conduits, and aging mechanical components.  Future sediment management projects are planned.  Risk communication includes conducting tabletop emergency exercises with first responders and other Federal, State, and local agencies.  Flood warnings to notify affected communities downstream of the project are coordinated with external entities.  Future risk communication activities include development of a formal risk communication plan and revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Tioga Dam in 1978 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on the Tioga River in Tioga County, PA, immediately upstream of the borough of Tioga.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Tioga Lake which provides water quality and recreation benefits.  Tioga Lake and adjacent Hammond Lake are connected by a channel and the dams are operated together as a single Tioga-Hammond Project.  Primary releases are made by gates which discharge flow through a conduit beneath the dam.  During significant flood events, flow from Tioga Lake can pass through the connecting channel to Hammond Lake where the Hammond dam includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Tioga Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s conduit and/or the project spillway at Hammond Dam during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the conduit and spillway release water to the Tioga River and Crooked Creek.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Tioga, Lawrenceville, Corning, Elmira and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Tioga, Chemung and North Branch Susquehanna Rivers would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Tioga Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the Center Hill Dam for Flood Control in 1948.  The dam is located near Smithville, TN and impounds the Caney Fork River, a major tributary of the Cumberland River.  The project was authorized by the 1938 Flood Control Act as part of an overall plan for the Ohio River Basin and is managed by the Nashville District, USACE.  Center Hill Dam plays a major role in flood risk management of the Cumberland River providing protection to Gordonsville, Carthage, and Nashville.  The dam has a maximum height of 226 feet, a total length of 2,160 feet, and consists of a concrete gravity section, earthen embankment, saddle dike topped with a fuse plug and powerhouse.  The dam routinely stores and releases water through its eight spillway gates, three hydropower turbines, and six low level sluice gates.  The spillway gates play a major role in water release during significant storm events.  Center Hill Dam impounds Center Hill Lake which has a total storage capacity of 2,100,000 acre-ft.  In addition to its originally authorized purposes of flood control and hydropower, Center Hill Dam and Lake Cumberland provide recreation, water supply, and water quality benefits for the basin and region.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a major investment in Center Hill Dam to ensure the project operates safely, including completion of a foundation grouting program, full length concrete barrier wall through the earthen embankment into the bedrock below, and construction of a roller compacted concrete stability berm downstream of the saddle dike.  Following this work, the dam was assessed in 2019 for any additional concerns and the risk associated with a dam breach after remediation was rated moderate. The project risk is currently driven by the consequences of an overtopping failure of the structure as a result of Tainter gate power supply issues causing increased flows and possible flooding downstream.  Consequences from a dam failure are expected to be high with major damage centers at Gordonsville, Carthage, Hendersonville, and Nashville.  The population at risk is estimated to be over 65,000.  Additional evaluation of the Tainter gates at Center Hill indicate there is insufficient structural capacity to operate at design loads.  Operation of the Tainter gates in certain loading conditions could cause failure of a gate or gates, leading to increased flows and inundation of structures downstream.  There are currently no operating restrictions in place and no plans to change how water releases are managed.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects the dam and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam with increased inspection and monitoring frequencies when action levels established by the PDT are exceeded.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Currently, USACE is aggressively pursuing the replacement of all eight spillway gates in order to restore full gate operability and keep the dam operating as designed.",

Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates have been developed for this dam since there is potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated.  This dam is authorized, designed, and operated for hydropower and flood damage reduction and stores water for those purposes.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure, severe downstream flooding would occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to store water to reduce downstream flooding that would occur naturally.   But during a very large flood, flooding would occur downstream, and failure would result in additional severe flooding downstream.  Flood mapping has been developed to indicate potential flooding extents during a range of river conditions for both breach and non-breach scenarios.  These maps should be used by the public and state and local emergency managers for their awareness and preparedness in the event of a dam breach incident.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Dresden Island Lock and Dam was begun by the State of Illinois in 1920 but was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1933 for the purpose of navigation.  Dresden Island Lock and Dam is located on the Illinois River near Channahon, Illinois. The project consists of a lock chamber and a dam. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 22 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 1,607 feet and consists of an arch dam that spans 110 feet for a proposed auxiliary lock that was never completed, a 35 feet long concrete ogee fixed spillway, a Tainter gate section with an overall length of 616 feet with 9 Tainter gates for regulating the upper pool, a 30 feet long concrete ogee ice chute spillway, a boiler house pier for producing steam during winter gate operations, a headgate section 298 feet in length with 18 original headgates permanently sealed with concrete in 1982, and an earthen embankment extending 500 feet from the headgate section to the Illinois and Michigan Canal to the north. During flood events on the Illinois River, the Tainter gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in June 2014 and classified the risk associated with Dresden Island Lock and Dam as low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from ice floes on the Tainter gates, barge impacts to the Tainter gates, Tainter gate counterweight submergence during large floods, failure of the Tainter gate machinery, and a failure of the miter gate anchorage resulting in a shutdown of the lock. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation.  There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Dresden Island Lock and Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Mosquito Creek Dam in 1943 across Mosquito Creek, which created the Mosquito Creek Lake, whose primary purpose is to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on Mosquito Creek and the Mahoning River, including Niles, Girard and Youngstown, Ohio. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $500 million. The reservoir also serves to store rainfall from late winter through early summer to augment flow during the drier late summer and early autumn months, provide water supply to downstream communities, and is used for recreational purposes.  The dam is composed of an earthen embankment that is a maximum of 47 feet high.  Ohio State Route 305 (Wilson Sharpsville Road) traverses a portion of the approximately one-mile long dam crest.  The reservoir levels are managed to approved levels throughout the year, normally by means of releases through a conduit that discharges water to the downstream Mosquito Creek.  In order to reduce the possibility that the reservoir will overtop the dam, a natural spillway, which consists of low ground, exists about eight miles distant from the dam, at the northwest end of the reservoir.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, we will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plan. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high reservoir levels may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with local residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current and forecasted lake levels at Pittsburgh District reservoirs are available to the public via the internet at:  \nhttps://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Portals/72/docs/WaterManagement/ResSumPlots.pdf.",

    "projectDescription": "Alamo Dam is located on the Bill Williams River, 32 miles upstream from its confluence with Lake Havasu on the Colorado River. The dam straddles the border of La Paz and Mohave Counties, Arizona, about 2.5 miles downstream from where Alamo Crossing once was before the reservoir was impounded. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Alamo Dam in 1968 as a multipurpose project for flood risk management, water conservation and supply, and recreation. While hydropower was initially authorized for the project, this purpose was determined to not be feasible and has never been constructed.  The project is also authorized to provide fish and wildlife benefits both upstream and downstream of the dam, so long as it does not reduce flood risk management and recreational benefits. The main features of Alamo Dam consist of an earthen embankment dam, an outlet works, and a detached broad crested spillway. The dam length is 975 feet and has a height of 283 feet above the original Bill Williams River streambed. Outflow through the dam is controlled using the outlet works gates.  Additional outflow capacity would utilize the unregulated spillway on the right side of the project.  The project reduces flooding risk to the community of Parker, and also provides flood protection to important arterial highways (State Hwy 95) and agricultural lands downstream.",
    "riskCharSummary": "In 2020, USACE conducted a periodic risk assessment for Alamo Dam and the dam was classified as a high risk.  This characterization indicates that the combination of a life or economic consequences with a likelihood of failure is high, and USACE considers this level of life-risk unacceptable except in extraordinary circumstances. The incremental risks are primarily driven by the potential for overtopping of the embankment from an extreme flood event which could result in downstream consequences. Seismic concerns were evaluated but did not contribute to the risk. The primary consequence centers are La Paz and Mohave Counties, Arizona and Riverside County, California. The estimated population at risk due to dam failure would be approximately 28,100 for these communities. Economic consequences are estimated to be over $2.5 Billion dollars.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure USACE is taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, USACE will continue to work closely with federal, state, and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises and incorporating any new information into the Alamo Dam Emergency Action Plan. USACE closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. USACE is working with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents and schools to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase this monitoring during lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Future risk communication activities include updates to the Emergency Action Plan and coordinating these plans with first responders and the development of a formal Risk Communication Plan.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Blue Springs Dam in 1988. Blue Springs Dam is located on the East Fork Little Blue River about 4.7 miles upstream of the confluence of the Little Blue River and East Fork Little Blue River. The Dam is located on the eastern outskirts of the greater Kansas City Metropolitan area within Jackson County, MO. The surrounding areas are developing suburbs. Areas immediately downstream of the dam are actively being developed in or near the Little Blue River floodplain as of 2024. The lower reach of the Little Blue River, near the Missouri River, is largely rural and consists of agricultural fields. Blue Springs Dam was authorized for flood control, recreation, fish & wildlife enhancement and water quality. Blue Springs Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $71 million (2023 price level) from 1988 to 2020. The dam is a rolled earth and rockfill embankment approximately 2,500 long and has a maximum height of approximately 70 feet above the streambed.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Blue Springs Dam was well constructed and is well maintained. The most recent risk assessment for Blue Springs Dam was completed in 2023, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as low. Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from the Blue Springs Dam would be spillway discharge due to large, long, or multiple precipitation events in a relatively small duration. Although such a precipitation event leading to the use of the spillway of the dam is rare, it is a possibility.  Far less likely scenarios that could lead to downstream flooding from Blue Springs Dam is embankment slope instability, internal erosion, or dam overtopping. Overtopping would take vast amounts of water as the inflow of the water from the East Fork Little Blue River and water from storms will have to be larger than the discharge from uncontrolled spillway. In these scenarios, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities (Independence, MO). Some water from a potential dam breach may overtop the levee at Lake City and proceed to the east along Fire Prairie Creek before reaching the Missouri River.  Some notable infrastructure impacted includes multiple senior care facilities and the MRLS 351-R Levee.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high reservoir levels. Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high reservoir level is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will continue to work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Hodges Village Dam in 2019 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Low. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from North Hartland Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist. \n\nThere are also three extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would result in failure of the dam and downstream flooding:  (1) A flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded, resulting in  flows over the top of the dam, even with maximum possible releases being made through the conduit, (2) flow over the spillway eroding the spillway and (3) flow behind the left spillway training wall eroding the embankment.   At the dikes, overtopping of Dikes 1 or 4 are also risk drivers.  Seepage around the Dike 1 cutoff wall of progressive sloughing of Dike 3 could also lead to dike failure. The probability of any of these failures occurring is low to very low; however, were any of these events to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Oxford, Webster, Dudley, MA and Thompson and Putnam, CT are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities further downstream would also be impacted, but less so. \n\nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Allegheny 8 Lock and Dam in 1931 across the Allegheny River.  The dam is located near Templeton PA, about 53 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, PA. The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam to Allegheny 9 Lock and Dam, which is near located near Rimer, PA. The dam consists of a concrete spillway section, which means that the river flows freely over it.  The lock provides a lift of about 18 feet, which is the height of the river level upstream of the dam (upper pool) above the river level downstream of the dam (lower pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  A privately-operated hydropower plant is located in line with the dam near the right bank of the river.  Intakes for water supply to nearby communities are situated in the upper pool. The upper pool also provides recreation opportunities for surrounding communities.  The dam provides about 9 million dollars in economic benefits to the region each year.  There are no means of controlling the flow over the dam and the dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.  The pool created by the dam provides recreation opportunities for the surrounding communities.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2021, which characterized the risk as very low, because there is no potential for life loss or significant economic damages in the unlikely event that the dam fails.  Although the dam holds back water, a dam failure at Allegheny 8 Lock and Dam would not result in the flooding of downstream communities.  \n\nIf the upper pool of the dam is released due to a dam failure, the primary consequences would be the loss of river navigation, water supply, recreation, and hydropower generation would be halted, resulting in a loss of economic benefits to the region of about 10 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping, hydropower generation, and boat recreation, which would damage the regional economy by about 9 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored.  Although this scenario is possible, the project has performed well for over 90 years without incident.  Due to the relatively low height of the dam, which lies entirely within the banks of the Allegheny River, downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communication and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam or that may adversely affect economic benefits.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications.  We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Wilson Dam, completing in 1963. Wilson Dam is located at river mile 130.4 on the Saline River in Russell County, Kansas, approximately 10 miles north of Wilson, Kansas and 50 miles west of Salina, Kansas. Serval communities including Sylvan Grove, Lincoln, Beverly, Tescott, Culver, and Salina, all in Kansas, are downstream of Wilson Dam. The dam was authorized for flood risk management, water conservation, recreation, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Wilson Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $3.1 billion (2010 price level) from 1964 to 2010. The dam is 5,600 feet long composed of compacted rolled earthfill. The top of the dam sits approximately 152 feet above the stream bed.  A controlled outlet works is used to make normal and emergency releases from the reservoir, and an uncontrolled spillway is used to provide additional release of water from the dam during major flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Wilson Dam in September 2014 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low. Based on the risk assessment the risks associated with Wilson dam are water overtopping the embankment during extreme flood events, erosion of the uncontrolled spillway during infrequent flooding events, high pore pressures leading to slope stability failure in the left abutment during extreme high pool, and internal erosion due to differential settlement near the right abutment. \n\nUSACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed Wilsons\u2019s storage capacity can cause the release of water through the outlet works or uncontrolled spillway to prevent overtopping and failure of dam, even if the river is at or beyond capacity. This can result in flooding at downstream areas or can worsen already existing flooding downstream due to the rivers being over capacity.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam is located on the Chattahoochee River in Chattahoochee Florida.  The dam was completed in 1957 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and resulted in the formation of Lake Seminole, a 59 square mile reservoir. \n\nThe Jim Woodruff Dam is constructed of earthen embankments and concrete, with a gated spillway, overflow dike, lock, weir spillway, gated spillway, and powerhouse. Water is released into the river downstream through the hydropower units, through the gated spillway, and in rare instances, over the weir spillway.  The overall dam length is 6,150 feet.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2020 and has classified the risks associated with the Jim Woodruff as Moderate.  The classification is driven by presence of limestone at the site with cavities that could enlarge over time and potentially destabilize portions of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, flooding would occur in the floodplain, with flood damage and potential for life loss.  In the event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be in flood-prone communities downstream of the dam to the vicinity of Blountstown, FL.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously working to manage the risk to the public.  This includes sharing inundation mapping with local emergency managers and periodically updating the Emergency Action Plan   USACE regularly inspects and monitors the dam and dam instruments to check the condition of the dam.  The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect problems.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.\n\nFlood risk awareness suggestions:\n\nExamine Jim Woodruff Dam breach and non-breach flood inundation layers to the right (from the NID Map Viewer, Layer Controls).\n\nCreate a family emergency plan and determine your evacuation route with the goal of getting to higher ground. \nVisit: www.ready.gov\n\nConnect with your local representatives and officials to sign up for personalized alerts.\nFlorida Division of Emergency Management\thttps://www.floridadisaster.org/\n\nConsider purchasing flood insurance to protect your property\nVisit: www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program\n\nConnect with the USACE to learn more about Jim Woodruff Dam. \nFollow the Mobile District on Facebook at www.facebook.com/USACEMOBILE/\nJim Woodruff Lock and Dam on Facebook  https://www.facebook.com/USACELakeSeminol",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Curwensville Dam in 1965 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on the West Branch Susquehanna River in Clearfield County, PA, approximately two miles upstream of the borough of Curwensville and eight miles upstream of the borough of Clearfield.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Curwensville Lake which provides water quality, water supply and recreation benefits. Releases are made by gates which discharge flow through a conduit beneath the dam.  The project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Curwensville Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, spillway releases water to the West Branch Susquehanna River.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Curwensville, Clearfield, Plymptonville and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the West Branch Susquehanna River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Curwensville Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 18 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in May 1937 for the purpose of navigation. Lock and Dam 18 is located on the Mississippi River near Gladstone, Illinois. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary miter gate bay, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section, a submersible earth dike, and a non-submersible earth dike. The main lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 10 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 7,020 feet and includes 1,350 feet of movable gate section, 2,200 feet of submersible earth dike, and 3,470 feet of non-submersible earthen dike. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in July 2015 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 18 as low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from a barge impact to the spillway gates, a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock, and flooding of the electrical equipment. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 18. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The John Hollis Bankhead Lock and Dam was authorized by Congress in the 1909 under the River and Harbors Act to generate hydropower, reduce flooding in downstream communities, navigation, and recreation.  Bankhead Dam is located on the Black Warrior River 23 miles upstream of Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  It was designed and constructed from 1911 to 1915 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to provide for the needs of navigation. The project was later modified to increase navigation channel depth to 9 feet in 1936.  In the late 1960\u2019s, the spillway was raised, and a new navigation lock was constructed on the east side of the river.\n\nThe dam is constructed of concrete, with a gated spillway, non-overflow dam, lock, and powerhouse. Water is released into the river through the spillway or through the turbines in the powerhouse.  The spillway is 1,170 feet long with a crest elevation of 241.5 feet and 22 gates. The single lift lock is 600 feet long and 110 feet wide with a lift of 69 feet.  Alabama Power Company owns and operates the powerhouse on the west end of the spillway.\n\nThe project provides an annual navigation benefit of about $300 million annually and also provides regional hydropower benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2015 that classified the risks associated with the John Hollis Bankhead Lock and Dam as Moderate.  The dam was found to be well-constructed and well-maintained and is expected to be reliable during major floods.  The dam could possibly be damaged or fail due to a nearby major earthquake of a magnitude that has not been experienced before in the area.  If this unlikely scenario were to occur flood waters would be extremely swift and deep and cause flooding downstream, economic impacts, and potentially loss of life.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be along the riverfront downstream of the dam, in areas of Tuscaloosa and Northport, Alabama.  Key infrastructure along the river could be damaged or destroyed and historic flooding on the river would occur to the vicinity of Demopolis, Alabama.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously working to manage the risk to the public.  This includes sharing flooding maps with state and county emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to assess the condition of the dam.  The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.\n\nSuggestions to improve flood risk awareness:\n\nExamine breach and non-breach flood inundation layers to the right (from the NID Map Viewer, Layer Controls).\n\nConnect with your local representatives and officials to sign up for personalized alerts.\nAlabama EMA Alerts and Warnings\thttps://ema.alabama.gov/publicnotice\n\nTuscaloosa County Emergency Management Agency   https://www.tuscaloosacountyema.org/\n\nCreate a family emergency plan and determine your evacuation route with the goal of getting to higher ground. \nVisit: www.ready.gov\n\nConsider purchasing flood insurance to protect your property.\nVisit: www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program\n\nConnect with the USACE to learn more about John Hollis Bankhead Lock and Dam. \nFollow the Mobile District on Facebook at www.facebook.com/USACEMOBILE/",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Farmington Dam in 1951. Farmington Dam is mostly surrounded by farmland and is located approximately 20 miles east of Stockton and approximately 3.5 miles east of Farmington. The dam is a compacted earthfill structure with an ungated spillway section that is located on the northern end of the dam. On the upstream side of the dam is the normally dry Farmington Reservoir, which only contains water when large rain events occur. The dam spans across two waterways: Littlejohn Creek, and Rock Creek. The purpose of Farmington Dam is to reduce the frequency of flooding throughout the network of channels downstream and protect the city of Stockton, the rural towns of French Camp and Farmington, and other nearby communities.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Farmington Dam in 2008 to understand how the dam might perform during certain scenarios and found the likelihood of the dam overtopping or failing in those cases to be moderate. Factors that pose some concerns and that might cause flooding downstream of the dam include extreme rainfall, snow melting in the Sierras, and earthquakes. A very large rainfall and snowmelt event with unusually large quantities of water could lead to larger than normal outflows of water through the dam and spillway. Such a scenario could cause downstream flooding even when the dam operates as intended. The most devastating potential scenario would occur if the dam were subjected to an extreme earthquake while the reservoir level was already high. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding of downstream communities. Another potential scenario involves water seeping through the dam materials, which could lead to uncontrolled loss of water from the reservoir. The downstream communities at risk primarily include the cities of Farmington and Stockton. Potentially impacted infrastructure includes road networks, electrical substations, communication facilities, police and fire stations, hospitals, airports, and schools. A large portion of farmland will also be impacted. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, there is an emergency action plan for Farmington Dam to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works closely with local emergency managers, regularly updates the emergency action plan, and conducts emergency exercises with state, federal, and local partners, all of which help reduce risk to the public. USACE performs regular inspections and instrument monitoring to ensure that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. The frequency of these checks increases when the reservoir rises. USACE incorporates weather forecasts to make informed decisions on how to operate the dam. The releases at Farmington Dam are determined using the knowledge of local flows in the system and there may be situations where these localized flows change quickly and could affect the downstream communities. In most scenarios, the downstream communities would have a coordinated warning notification within minutes to hours depending on location before water reaches their homes. However, during very large and rare earthquake events, there may be little to no warning.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Opekiska Lock and Dam across the Monongahela River in 1967.  The dam is located about 13 miles downstream of the head of the Monongahela River at Fairmont, West Virginia and about 115 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to the head of the Monongahela River.  The dam is concrete and has four steel gates through which the river flows.  The lock provides a lift of about 22 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 84 feet wide by 600 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The pool created by the dam also provides water supply to municipal and industrial intakes and provides recreation opportunities. The economic benefits of shipping materials and goods, water supply, and recreation through the lock is approximately 700 thousand dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2009, which characterized the risk as low. The assessment identified one primary scenario that could cause the dam to fail.  When the river is at normal levels, water seeping around the concrete lock walls could erode the soil behind the walls, to the extent that the river could flow around the dam and drain the upper pool.  If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequences would be the loss of shipping, water supply, and recreation, which would damage the regional economy by approximately 700 thousand dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping, water supply, and boat recreation.  This scenario is considered very unlikely because the dam has performed well for over 50 years without incident or indications that this scenario is occurring.  Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We regularly update our emergency action plan. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Inundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.  More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of the Prado Dam in 1941 to provide flood risk management on the Santa Ana River.  Additional authorized project purposes now include water conservation and recreation.  The dam is located in San Bernardino County, California approximately 2 miles west of the City of Corona, and on the lower Santa Ana River approximately 30.5 miles upstream of the confluence with the Pacific Ocean.  Prado Dam and Reservoir serve as the principal regulating structure on the Santa Ana River.  The dam is comprised of an earth-filled embankment with a top of dam length of 2,280 feet and reaches of height above the streambed of 106 feet.  The dam has two methods for releasing floodwaters: 1) an outlet structure in the west abutment consisting of an intake structure, two box conduits that run from the reservoir to downstream, and an outlet channel, 2) an uncontrolled spillway constructed through a bluff on the east abutment.  The Prado Dam reduces the risk of flooding to more than 1.3 million people working in four counties and more than $80 billion in property.  The reservoir is typically dry but has the capacity to store large volumes of water resulting in an estimated $207 million in annual flood damage reduction benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The USACE conducted a dam safety risk assessment of Prado Dam in 2019 and classified the dam as high risk.  The combination of life or economic consequences with the likelihood is high and USACE considers this level of life-risk to be unacceptable except in extraordinary circumstances.  The assessment identified concerns with the performance of the spillway and the potential for flood waters to flow between the dam embankment and spillway during a major flood event.  This could potentially result in dam failure, flooding several cities between the dam and ocean.  The USACE is currently undertaking a study with planned modifications of Prado Dam to provide additional capacity for floodwater and sediment storage.  Modifications to the dam embankment and outlet works were made in 2008, and other embankments, or dikes, have been and are currently being constructed throughout the reservoir.  The USACE is working with a national team of experts to analyze the modifications to ensure risk is being decreased as low as reasonably practical.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure USACE is taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises and incorporating any new information into our Emergency Action Plan. USACE closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. USACE is working with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents and schools to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase this monitoring during lake level rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Smithville Dam, completing in 1979. Smithville Dam is located on the Little Platte River in Clay County, about one mile northeast of Smithville, Missouri and approximately 20 miles north of Kansas City, Missouri. Downstream of the dam is the community of Smithville, Missouri. The dam was authorized for flood control, water supply, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Smithville Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $1.6 billion (2018 price level) from 1977 to 2017. The dam is approximately 4,000 feet long composed of rolled earthfill. The top of the dam sits approximately 100 feet above the riverbed. Additionally, two rim dikes complete the reservoir rim.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed Smithville\u2019s storage capacity can cause the release of water down the uncontrolled spillway, even if the river at or beyond capacity to prevent overtopping and failure of dam. This can result in flooding at downstream areas or can worsen already existing flooding downstream due to the rivers being over capacity. \n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment for Smithville Dam in October 2019 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the risk due to dam breach is characterized as low. In an extreme flood scenario, inflows into the lake may exceed the storage and release capacity of the dam, and overtopping may occur. If overtopping occurs the earthen embankment of dam could erode leading to a sudden release of water downstream. This would result in extreme flooding downstream to the community of Smithville, MO.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built North Hartland Dam in 1958 to 1961 across the Ottauquechee River. North Hartland Dam holds a 215-acre recreation pool outside of flood events.  The dam holds back additional water during flood events and works together with nearby Union Village and North Springfield Dams to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Connecticut River. The dam was built in response to the severe flooding that occurred in the region in the 1930\u2019s. Since it began operations, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $207 million.\n\nThe dam is made of compacted earth and rock fill and is approximately 18 stories (185 feet) high. A 14.3-foot diameter concrete pipe called a conduit passes through the dam.  In 1985, this conduit was lined with a 12-foot diameter stainless steel penstock as part of a downstream hydropower operation.  Metal gates at the upstream side of the conduit are opened to allow water to pass through the dam and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events. To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the spillway, a sloped concrete structure located at the north end of the dam. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing. The spillway is longer than a football field and approximately two stories below the top of the dam. \n\nA dike, located south of the main dam, is made of compacted earth and rock fill and is approximately 5 stories high.  A 3-foot diameter concrete pipe passes through the dike.  A metal gate is used to control flow through the dike conduit.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of North Hartland Dam in 2014 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Moderate. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from North Hartland Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist. \n\nThere are also two extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would result in failure of the dam or dike and downstream flooding:  (1) A flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded, resulting in  flows over the top of the dam, even with maximum possible releases being made through the conduit, and (2) water seeping through the dam or dike earth embankments results in voids in these structures as the soil erodes, potentially weakening the structures. Were any of these events to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Hartland, White River Junction, Windsor VT and West Lebanon, NH are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities further downstream, including Ascutney, Bellows Falls, and Westminster, VT, and Charlestown and Walpole, NH would also be impacted, but less so. \n\nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges. In a worst case scenario, you could see water higher than a three story building.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists at North Hartland Dam. Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we are taking actions to further reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of North Hartland Dam and will modify operations if we feel there is risk to the public. We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner. USACE is planning for additional studies to further understand the risk associated with North Hartland Dam, and what, if any, actions can be completed to reduce the risk.",

    "projectDescription": "Lockport Lock & Controlling Works is part of the Chicago Area Waterways System (CAWS) that reversed the flow of the Chicago and Calumet Rivers away from Lake Michigan toward the Mississippi River. The current authorized project purpose is to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel. The project also provides power generation benefits.  The main components of the project include a 110-foot wide by 600-foot-long main lock having a lift of 39-feet, with upstream gates consisting of a vertical lift guard and a service gate, each 118-feet wide by 24-feet tall and weighing 180 tons, and a pair of miter gates 65-feet wide by 59-feet tall at the downstream end, each weighing 246 tons.  There is an abandoned lock with a concrete bulkhead on the upstream end of the lock, one 20-foot sluice gate on a concrete spillway, and a powerhouse. On the right descending bank (RDB) there is a roller compacted concrete forebay wall, an approach dike with a slurry cutoff wall, an approach dike with an impermeable core, a bear trap dam that has been removed and replaced with a concrete cutoff wall, and the controlling works which includes seven operable sluice gates and eight bulk-headed sluice gate bays. The left descending bank (LDB) consists of a concrete panel guide wall.  Lockport is a high-hazard potential navigation project located 291.1 miles upstream of the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi River near the city of Lockport, IL. The upper pool extends about 35 miles upstream on the Calumet River to T.J. O\u2019Brien Lock and Dam and 36 miles upstream to the Chicago Lock on the Chicago River, both of which lead out to Lake Michigan.  The Brandon Road Lock and Dam is located downstream about 5 miles at River Mile 286.0.  The Controlling Works are approximately 2 miles upstream of the lock.  The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) designed and constructed the original Lockport project, with the Controlling Works becoming operational in 1896 and the original lock and Powerhouse in 1907.   The State of Illinois designed and partially constructed the existing lock from 1923 to 1930. The federal government, by authority of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930, completed construction and opened the lock in 1933. \nIn 1984, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the Department of the Army (DA) through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the MWRD, transferred primary maintenance responsibility of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC) to the USACE. This memorandum divides up responsibility between both organizations, specifically addressing features along the CSSC.  The CAWS is regulated by the MWRD, who is responsible for flood control and sanitary wastewater disposal in the metropolitan Chicago area. MWRD is also responsible for operating and maintaining the Powerhouse.  USACE responsibility within the CAWS is to operate and maintain the lock, maintain the features forming the dam, and to maintain the navigation channel.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Lockport Lock and Dam on 9 September 2022 and the risk was found to be very low.  Lockport L&D is a key facility to maintain navigation in the CAWS, it also helps with flood risk management within the Chicago metropolitan area by allowing the waterway levels to be lowered during intense rain events.  However, as the pool level is over 30-feet above the natural ground near Lockport, IL, a potential breach could cause significant flooding, especially in areas along the left bank in Lockport and further downstream in Joliet.  Two risk drivers have been documented following a recent risk assessment. One is related to the performance of the Controlling Works, a project feature of the Lockport Lock & Controlling Works that has dual maintenance responsibilities by USACE and MWRD. The other is related to the performance of the left descending canal wall that retains the perched canal. The consequences of a dam failure at this project are economic losses, and potential for life loss and possible impact to the railway in some areas along the left bank.  MWRD manages the pool ahead of large precipitation events by conducting operational releases at the Controlling Works to lower the water levels in the pool to account for the increasing inflows.  Operational releases send water from the pool into the Des Plaines River running adjacent to the right descending bank. The released water joins the navigation channel directly downstream of the lock and powerhouse. The next downstream dam is the Brandon Road Lock & Dam that has substantial capacity to manage the increased flows from Lockport and not be affected by these operational releases.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE has implemented several measures to manage risk at the Lockport Lock and Dam.  Project staff is continuously on-site to operate and maintain the lock with rapid communication with the Chicago Lock, T.J. O'Brien Lock and Dam upstream, and Brandon Road Lock and Dam downstream to communicate and minimize impacts to navigation.  Close coordination occurs regularly between USACE and MWRD to identify and respond to issues that may arise.  USACE repair crews are available at Peoria, IL for rapid response to critical issues and other resources can be brought in quickly if needed.  The project has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that is coordinated with MWRD, the cities of Lockport and Joliet, and the State of Illinois.  USACE completed a major rehabilitation project between 2008 and 2015. The major rehabilitation constructed a concrete cutoff wall keyed into bedrock along the right descending bank approach dike, installed a precast panel tie-back system to reinforce the canal wall along the left descending bank, repaired the piers and structure at the Controlling Works, replaced the existing powerhouse forebay wall embankment with a roller-compacted concrete forebay wall, removed trees from the embankments, and filled the abandoned exciter bays at the powerhouse with flowable fill to stop the minor leakage penetrating into the powerhouse. USACE dewatered the lock in the fall of 2019 for inspection and repairs to the lock structure and operating systems.  USACE also maintains an array of instruments at the project to monitor performance.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Black Butte Dam in 1963. Black Butte Dam is located on Stony Creek, about 9 miles northwest of Orland, California. The dam structure consists of an earthfill embankment and includes an ungated, earthen spillway channel located near the northern end of the dam. There is a hydropower facility located just downstream from the dam that is owned and operated by the City of Santa Clara under a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Black Butte Dam reduces the risk of flooding primarily to the city of Orland and other nearby communities by holding back water during major flood events. In addition to reducing flooding downstream, the water held back by the dam forms Black Butte Lake.  Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam also provides irrigation, hydropower generation, recreation, and environmental stewardship benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Black Butte Dam has historically performed well and significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not fully eliminate the potential for downstream flooding. USACE completed a risk assessment for Black Butte Dam in 2008 to understand how the dam might perform during certain scenarios and found the likelihood of the dam overtopping or failing in those cases to be moderate. Factors that do pose some concern and that might cause flooding downstream of Black Butte Dam include the dam\u2019s spillway and earthquakes. A very rare and extreme flood event could cause the water level of Black Butte Lake to flow over the top of the dam. The earth spillway channel could also erode during high flows. In addition, an unlikely major earthquake could cause the soil in the dam and under the dam\u2019s foundation to temporarily move like a liquid, which can result in significant deformations and strength loss of the dam. The resulting deformations and strength loss can disrupt materials inside the dam. This in turn could initiate water seeping through the dam materials which could eventually lead to uncontrolled loss of water from the reservoir. If this were to occur when Black Butte Lake is at maximum capacity, the downstream communities will see significant flooding which could potentially result in loss of human life, economic impacts, and environmental damage. The population at risk includes portions of the cities of Orland, Hamilton, Butte and Colusa as well as rural population in the floodplain. Potentially impacted infrastructure includes road networks, electrical substations, communication facilities, police and fire stations, hospitals, airports, and schools. A large portion of farmland will also be impacted. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, there is an emergency action plan for Black Butte Dam to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works closely with local emergency managers, regularly updates the emergency action plan, and conducts emergency exercises with state, federal, and local partners, all of which help reduce risk to the public. USACE has full-time staff members who work at Black Butte Dam. The staff performs regular maintenance and repairs as needed to keep the dam functioning properly and are available 24/7 to perform immediate inspections if an unusual event occurs. USACE performs regular inspections and instrument monitoring to ensure that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. The frequency of these checks increases when Black Butte Lake rises. USACE incorporates weather forecasts to make informed decisions on how to operate the dam. The releases at Black Butte Dam are determined using the knowledge of local flows in the system and there may be situations where these localized flows change quickly and could affect the downstream communities. In most scenarios, the downstream communities would have a coordinated warning notification within minutes to hours depending on location before water reaches their homes. However, during very large and rare earthquake events, there may be little to no warning.",

    "projectDescription": "Wallace Lake Dam is a flood risk management structure owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), completed in 1946. Located on Wallace Bayou, a tributary of Twelve Mile Bayou in the Red River Basin, the dam helps protect Shreveport, Louisiana, and surrounding areas from damaging floods. The structure provides critical water control benefits while also supporting public recreation in Caddo Parish.\nWallace Lake Dam is an earthen embankment approximately 3,500 feet long and 46 feet high. It was designed to impound floodwaters during periods of high rainfall, gradually releasing water downstream through its gated outlet structure to reduce peak flow and prevent flooding in the Shreveport area. This operation is guided by a congressionally authorized Water Control Plan to optimize flood protection while maintaining seasonal water levels for environmental and recreational purposes.\nThe dam includes a gated concrete conduit at its base that allows precise control of outflows from Wallace Lake into Twelve Mile Bayou. During times of low flow, these gates maintain base streamflow, while in flood conditions, the gates are used to gradually release stored water to mitigate downstream impacts. The project does not feature a traditional spillway; instead, an emergency spillway is designed to pass excess water in extreme flood events, preventing overtopping of the dam.\nWallace Lake itself provides valuable habitat for fish and wildlife and supports recreational uses such as boating, fishing, and birdwatching. Management of lake levels balances these recreational uses with flood risk reduction efforts.\nLike many mid-20th century flood control structures, Wallace Lake Dam continues to be evaluated for performance under modern safety standards, including seismic risk, hydrologic loading, and foundation stability. Ongoing maintenance and periodic safety inspections help ensure the dam remains a reliable component of the region\u2019s flood management infrastructure.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Wallace Lake Dam significantly reduces downstream flood risks in Caddo and De Soto Parishes, Louisiana; however, it does not eliminate the potential for flooding or dam-related emergencies. Wallace Lake Dam is classified as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4, indicating low incremental risk and low urgency for action, based on the most recent Periodic Assessment (2021).\nAlthough the dam has historically performed as designed, unlikely but high-consequence scenarios could still occur. Three primary potential failure modes (PFMs) drive the project\u2019s life safety risk profile:\n\nShallow slough slides could lower the dam crest, resulting in overtopping under extreme flood conditions.\nSeepage and piping through foundation sands at Sta. 40+00 to 45+00, possibly leading to instability during high head differentials.\nOvertopping erosion during a Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) or larger event, with a modeled breach expected during a 150% PMF event.\nWhile each of these PFMs has a very low annual probability of failure, in such an event, flooding would be swift and potentially deadly, with the greatest risk posed to downstream areas along Bayou Pierre and potentially as far as Powhatan, LA\u2014approximately 50 miles from the dam.\nAdditionally, non-breach flood risks remain a concern. Wallace Lake Dam is designed as a dry detention structure, but under extreme inflows, the uncontrolled spillway and outlet works may not be sufficient to prevent flooding of nearby low-lying developments and in-pool residential neighborhoods. \nWhile there are no dam safety deficiencies currently requiring urgent intervention, key risk management challenges have been identified:\nSeveral shallow slides have occurred on both upstream and downstream slopes, with some unrepaired for extended periods. Surveys reveal low spots along the embankment crest that could reduce freeboard and increase overtopping vulnerability. Cracking in the spillway weir raises concern about stability under high loading conditions, especially when water levels exceed historical maximums. Limited instrumentation, particularly the absence of piezometers or crest reference markers, reduces confidence in seepage and settlement monitoring. Historical sand boils and eroded joints in the abutment walls suggest seepage paths that require continued observation.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Despite these concerns, the project is currently managed under routine operations and maintenance protocols. USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Wallace Lake Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing pool conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.\nNevertheless, risk communication and public awareness in upstream and downstream communities\u2014particularly around in-pool residential developments\u2014remain areas needing improvement.\nIn the unlikely event of a dam failure or major flood, emergency alerts and evacuation will be critical. Residents in the affected area should stay informed and follow all guidance from local authorities. To better understand your individual risk, visit the National Inventory of Dams (NID) for inundation maps and preparedness resources.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Green River Dam in 1969. Green River Dam is located on the Green River, 305.7 miles above its confluence with the  Ohio River. The project is located in Taylor and Adair Counties in southcentral Kentucky, approximately 90 air miles south-southwest of Louisville, Kentucky, and 10 miles southwest of Campbellsville, Kentucky. The Green River Project consists of the following structures: an earth and rock fill dam, an earth filled dike, a gate-controlled outlet works along the base of the right abutment of the dam, and a 450-foot wide, uncontrolled, open cut spillway through the ridge between the dam and the dike. The dam embankment is 2,350 feet long with a maximum height of 143 feet. The dike consists of a 1,952-foot-long earthen embankment with a maximum height of 105 feet. Green River Dam reduces flooding along the Green River to its confluence with the Ohio River. The dam has a drainage area of approximately 682 miles. The record pool elevation of 704.71 ft-NAVD88 occurred in January 1979, and did not result in spillway flow (El 712.51 ft NAVD88).",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Green River Dam in June 2017 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4 which is considered Low relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not eliminate the risk completely. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to result in unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway. There is also a very unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is erosion of the dam and/or dike earthen embankment during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach of the dam and/or dike. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along the Green River.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream areas. The largest impacts would be Greensburg, Brownsville, and Morgantown, Kentucky. In Greensburg, flooding would impact essential structures such as police stations, fire stations, electric substations, and school buildings.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast, and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather Service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE monitors on-site instruments and conducts regular inspections to ensure the health and integrity of the dam. The frequency of these inspections increases when the lake level rises. This ensures the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Richard L. Schafer Dam, formerly known as Success Dam in 1961. The dam is located on the Tule River about 5 miles east of and upstream from Porterville in Tulare County, California. Richard L. Schafer Dam reduces the frequency of flooding to the city of Porterville and other nearby communities by holding back water during major flood events. In addition to reducing flooding downstream, the water held back by the dam forms Success Lake. Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam also provides irrigation, recreation, and environmental stewardship benefits to nearby communities. The dam structure is primarily an earthfill embankment with an ungated spillway located to the right of the main dam. In addition to the main dam, Frasier Dike is located along the Northwest side of Success Lake that helps protect upstream communities during high water events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Richard L. Schafer Dam has historically performed adequately and significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not fully eliminate the potential for downstream flooding.  USACE completed a baseline risk assessment for Richard L. Schafer Dam in September of 2015 to understand how the dam might perform during certain scenarios and found the risk of the dam overtopping or failing in those cases to be moderate. Factors that do pose some concern and that might cause flooding downstream of the dam include extreme rainfall, and earthquakes. A very large rainfall event with unusually large quantities of water could lead to larger than normal outflows of water through the dam and spillway. Even when the dam operates as intended, such a scenario could cause downstream flooding. In some scenarios, downstream levees near Porterville could be overtopped or impacted by large flows over the spillway. The most devastating potential scenario would occur if the dam were subjected to a large earthquake while the lake level was already high. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the lake, resulting in potentially deadly flooding of Porterville, CA, and other agricultural downstream communities. Another potential scenario involves water seeping through the dam and carrying soil particles away from the part of the dam that meets the natural landscape when Success Lake is at a higher elevation and portions of the dam are washed away. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, Richard L. Schafer Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works closely with local emergency managers, regularly updates the emergency action plan, and conducts emergency exercises with state, federal, and local partners, all of which help reduce risk to the public. USACE has full-time staff members who work at Richard L. Schafer Dam. The staff performs regular maintenance and repairs as needed to keep the dam functioning properly and are available 24/7 to perform immediate inspections if an unusual event occurs.  Regular inspections and instrument monitoring ensure that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. The frequency of these checks increases when Success Lake rises. USACE incorporates weather forecasts to make informed decisions on how to operate the dam. The releases at Richard L. Schafer Dam are determined using the knowledge of local flows in the system and there may be situations where these localized flows change quickly and could affect the downstream communities. In most scenarios the downstream communities would have hours, or even days, from a coordinated warning notification before water reaches their homes. However, during very large and rare earthquake events, there may be little to no warning.",

    "projectDescription": "Nestled in the Ouachita Mountains of southwest Arkansas across the Ouachita River, Blakely Mountain Dam is located 10 miles west of Hot Springs. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed the dam in 1955 with the primary purpose of reducing the frequency of flooding to downstream communities along the Ouachita River. The dam also produces hydropower on demand for Arkansas Southwest Power Administration (SWPA) and provides recreation opportunities along the reservoir and adjacent forested lands. Additionally, downstream areas rely on the dam to release enough continuous flows so that river water levels are sufficient for communities to draw drinking water and for support of wildlife.\n\nThe dam structure is an earthen embankment that stands over 200 feet high and is armored with a rock riprap cover. A separate overflow spillway structure is located in a ridge approximately one mile west of the dam at the end of the first upstream cove. The spillway, made up of compacted soil lined with rock (with a concrete saddle across the top), is designed to remove excess water from the reservoir after extremely heavy rainfall. However, to date, the spillway at Blakely Mountain Dam has not been used.\n\nIn 1980, routine maintenance of instrumentation resulted in a point of high pressure within the dam that potentially caused cracking along the contact between the embankment and the foundation. USACE closely monitors the area and installed an earthen berm in 2009 that collects water moving through the dam to see if there are any changes that would indicate a possible increase in water seeping through and eroding the dam. USACE has also taken measures to prevent similar high-pressure incidents from occurring in the future. Today, the areas downstream of the project that could be impacted from failure of the dam include over 44,000 residents, and the dam reduces the frequency of flooding to homes and business along with a variety of infrastructure including hospitals, schools, power generation facilities, water treatment facilities, and more. To prepare your family against possible flooding, please visit the National Inventory of Dams (NID) website to see maps showing the potential extent of flooding locations if Blakely Mountain Dam were to breach.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Blakely Mountain Dam in April 2020 and has classified the risks associated with the project as moderate. A major storm with significant rainfall west of Hot Springs, upstream of Lake Ouachita, would lead to significant increases in the reservoir level which could potentially cause the dam to overtop and fail.\n\nIf the reservoir level rises above the overflow spillway, water would spill across the concrete saddle at the top, potentially causing it to break apart as the water erodes the earthen and rock spillway below. Because the spillway has not been used in the past, there is uncertainty about how it would perform in such a situation. Another issue is the possibility of cracking where the earthen dam contacts the rock foundation below, leading to water seeping through and causing erosion along the crack. Water flowing through even a small fracture could continue to grow, allowing more water to flow through, eventually leading to a failure.\n\nAs a result of either of these scenarios, near downstream areas along the Ouachita River including Mountain Pine could have less than one hour to evacuate while areas farther downstream, from Hot Springs to Malvern, would also need to evacuate quickly. In a worst-case scenario, a large portion of land in Garland and Hot Spring Counties will experience some flooding, and local highways would be flooded. Flooding downstream would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and infrastructure, potentially killing anyone remaining in the area. It could cause water depths across highways 27, 70 and 270 so deep that those roadways would need to be closed. In addition, the downstream reservoirs of Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine would also quickly fill with water and overflow.\n\nAdditionally, reservoir levels that rise above the overflow spillway at Blakely Mountain Dam will lead to increased downstream water levels in Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine, even if failure of the dam or spillway does not occur. Because Lake Ouachita has never experienced reservoir levels to this degree, downstream communities may not be aware of the potential for high water downstream of Blakely Mountain Dam during spillway flow.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure Blakely Mountain Dam continues to operate to minimize flood risk and provide hydroelectric and water supply benefits, USACE has developed a surveillance and monitoring plan for the project, and performs increased surveillance during flooding with continuous monitoring of the dam at greater frequencies during periods of high water. USACE regularly inspects the dam and its components quarterly, annually, and periodically at various levels of detail. USACE also keeps emergency supplies and equipment on-site to be able to quickly respond to and flood fight any incidents that could occur at the dam.\n\nUSACE performs periodic risk assessments on a 10-year frequency with the most recent assessment performed in 2020 to identify issues, determine project risk, and quantify downstream impacts. Interim Risk-Reduction Measures (IRRMs) are in place to reduce the risk of the project in the near term which includes a berm and a seepage collection system which have been installed at the dam to monitor for seepage. Other risk management actions include community outreach to increase risk awareness, periodic interactions with local Emergency Managers to increase state and local official preparedness, and emergency exercises on a 5-year frequency to practice the project's Emergency Action Plan (EAP).",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Colebrook River Dam in 1965 to 1968 across the West Branch Farmington River. The dam holds back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Farmington and Connecticut Rivers. The dam was built in response to the severe flooding that occurred in the region in 1955. Since it began operations, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $177 million. The Colebrook River Dam was also constructed to provide reservoir storage for water supply, hydropower, and fisheries conservation. The Metropolitan District of Connecticut (MDC) and USACE have an agreement to provide drinking water from the Colebrook River Dam reservoir.  As of 2021 however, no water infrastructure has been constructed. In 2019, the Metropolitan District of Hartford, owner of the hydropower station at Colebrook River Dam, removed all hydroelectric equipment from the dam.\n\nThe dam is made of compacted earth fill with rock slope protection and is approximately 22 stories (223 feet) high. A 10-foot diameter rock cut tunnel called a conduit passes through the foundation rock beneath the dam.  Metal gates at the upstream side of the conduit are opened to allow water to pass through the dam and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events. To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the spillway, a sloped concrete structure located at the northeast end of the dam. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing. The spillway is 205 feet long and approximately three stories below the top of the dam. \n\nThe dam and its reservoir work in conjunction with a dike located half a mile southwest of the dam. The dike is typically not impounded with water, and only holds back water during flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Colebrook River Dam in 2019 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Moderate. This classification is based primarily on the large population living downstream of the dam that could experience catastrophic flooding in the very unlikely event of a failure of the dam. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Colebrook River Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist. \n\nThere is also an extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would result in failure of the dam and downstream flooding.  A flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded, resulting in flows over the top of the dam, even with maximum possible releases being made through the conduit. If this event were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Riverton, Canton, and New Hartford, CT are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities further downstream, including Farmington, Hartford, Simsbury, and Windsor, CT would also be impacted, but less so. \n\nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unawares and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges. In a worst case scenario, you could see a wave higher than a six story building.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists at Colebrook River Dam. Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we are taking actions to further reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of Colebrook River Dam and will modify operations if we feel there is risk to the public. We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner. USACE  will be undertaking additional study to further understand the risk associated with Colebrook River Dam, and what, if any, actions can be completed to reduce the risk.",

    "riskCharSummary": "Inundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.  More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Canton Dam in 1948 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities. The dam consists of an earthen embankment, a primary gated concrete spillway, a secondary concrete spillway and four earthen dikes. The project is located on the North Canadian River about 2 miles north of Canton, OK in Blaine County.  During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream for communities along the North Canadian River.  This stored water can then be released in a more controlled manner to reduce dangerous flooding.  These releases are regulated by the primary spillway gates.  For large flood events, the auxiliary spillway allows additional storage release to help prevent dam overtopping. The dam also provides local benefits including water supply for Oklahoma City, agricultural irrigation and recreation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2017 and classified the risk associated with the dam as very low.  Although extremely unlikely, the primary risks to the integrity of the dam are the potential for (1) Mechanical or electrical issues causing gate failure, and (2) instability of the concrete portion of the dam,.   In the remote event of a dam failure, the largest impacts would be to Oklahoma City.  Other impacted areas would be the towns of Canton, Watonga, Greenfield, Calumet, El Reno, and Shawnee.   There is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation of the dam which could include large releases through the gated spillway during a large flood.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Construction remediation efforts were completed within the last 10 years to improve the safety of the structure which contributed to the very low risk rating.  This work included construction of an auxiliary spillway, anchoring the primary spillway to ensure its stability, and widening the earthen dam and constructing a new drainage system to collect water seeping beneath the dam.\nThere are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage the risk that is posed to downstream communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the EAP to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. These instruments are monitored regularly for any early indications of potential safety concerns at the project.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 17 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in January 1939 for the purpose of navigation. Lock and Dam 17 is located on the Mississippi River near New Boston, Illinois. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary miter gate bay, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section, a submersible earth dike, and a non-submersible earth dike. The main lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 8 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 3,197 feet and includes 922 feet of movable gate section, 1,555 feet of submersible earth dike, and 720 feet of non-submersible earthen dike. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in March 2017 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 17 as very low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from trunnion friction failure of a spillway gate, a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock, and a miter gate anchorage bar failure due to fatigue. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 17. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Emsworth Locks and Dams across the Ohio River at Neville Island, PA in 1922.  There are two dams, one on each side of Neville Island, which splits the Ohio River into two channels.  In 1938, the dams were modified to include gates across the tops of the dams to better control river levels.  The locks and dams have undergone several rehabilitations, the most recent of which was completed in 2014.  The dams are situated in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, about 6 miles downstream of the head of the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dams is to create a navigation pool from the dams upstream to Allegheny River Lock and Dam 2, and Braddock Locks and Dam which is on the Monongahela River. The locks provide a lift of 18 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The locks allow river traffic to travel upstream and downstream of the dam.  The locks are rectangular chambers that are 110 feet wide by 600 feet long (main chamber)  and 56 feet wide by 360 feet long (auxiliary chamber).  The lock chambers are next to each other and are formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The upper pool is used for water supply intakes for nearby communities and provides recreational opportunities for metropolitan Pittsburgh.  The total benefits to the region are nearly 400 million dollars each year.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Emsworth Locks and Dams across the Ohio River at Neville Island, PA in 1922.  There are two dams, one on each side of Neville Island, which splits the Ohio River into two channels.  In 1938, the dams were modified to include gates across the tops of the dams to better control river levels.  The locks and dams have undergone several rehabilitations, the most recent of which was completed in 2014.  The dams are situated in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, about 6 miles downstream of the head of the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dams is to create a navigation pool from the dams upstream to Allegheny River Lock and Dam 2, and Braddock Locks and Dam which is on the Monongahela River. The locks provide a lift of 18 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The locks allow river traffic to travel upstream and downstream of the dam.  The locks are rectangular chambers that are 110 feet wide by 600 feet long (main chamber)  and 56 feet wide by 360 feet long (auxiliary chamber).

    "projectDescription": "The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Pike Island Locks and Dam across the Ohio River in 1963.  The locks and dam are located near Wheeling, West Virginia about 84 miles downstream from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The dam is concrete and includes a fixed concrete spillway and 9 gated bays through which  the river flows.  The locks provide a lift of about 21 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool upstream of the dam (upper pool).  Beyond the right side of the dam is flat ground that allows access for fishing.  The locks allow river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The locks include a main chamber that is 1,200 feet long and 110 feet wide and a second, auxiliary chamber that is 600 feet long by 110 feet wide.  The lock chambers are adjacent to each other and are formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The pool created by the dam also provides water supply for municipal and industrial intakes, and recreational purposes. The total benefits to the region are more than 540 million dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2018, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as low. This assessment identified two primary scenarios that could  cause the dam to fail, which would release water from the upper pool:  1) A runaway barge could become trapped on the dam which could prevent one or more dam gates from closing; and 2) the river could erode the soil of the fishing access area on the right side of the dam, to the extent that the river could bypass the dam and flow around it.  Either of these scenarios, although very unlikely, could result in a loss of the upper pool, to the extent that river traffic would be halted.  If the upper pool was lost, the main primary consequences would be the temporary loss of shipping and water supply, which would damage the regional economy by more than 540 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping and water supply.  Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure all steps are being taken to reduce the risk to the economy, we conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communications and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam\u2019s upper pool or that may adversely affect shipping.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Rathbun Dam, completing in 1969. Rathbun Dam is located on the Chariton River in Appanoose County, approximately five miles north of Centerville, Iowa. Downstream of the dam is the community of Rathbun, Iowa and agricultural land. The dam was authorized for flood control, water quality, water supply, recreation, fish & wildlife enhancement, and navigation. Rathbun Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $371.6 million (2018 price level) from 1969 to 2016. The dam is composed of two separate rolled earthen embankments, the main embankment and the Buck Branch embankment. A connection channel located within 1300 feet of the main embankment and within 900 feet of the Buck Branch embankment serves to create a single reservoir. The main embankment is 8,160 feet long and stands up to 100 feet above the stream bed. The Buck Branch embankment is 1,960 feet long and 75 feet above the floodplain. There is a 500-foot-wide uncontrolled notch spillway with anchored concrete sill located approximately 3,000 feet west of the main embankment abutment.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed Rathbun\u2019s storage capacity can cause the release of water through the uncontrolled spillway to prevent overtopping and failure of dam, even if the river downstream is at or beyond capacity. This can result in flooding at downstream areas or can worsen already existing flooding downstream due to the rivers being over capacity. \n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment for Rathbun Dam in April 2018 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the risk due to dam breach is characterized as low. In an extreme flood scenario, inflows into the lake may exceed the storage and release capacity of the dam, and overtopping may occur. If overtopping occurs the earthen embankment of the dam could erode leading to a sudden release of water downstream. This would result in extreme flooding in the community of Rathbun and the agricultural land downstream.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 20 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in November 1933 for the purpose of navigation. Lock and Dam 20 is located on the Mississippi River near Canton, Missouri. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary miter gate bay, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section and a non-submersible earth dike. The main lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 10 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 2,294 feet and includes 2,144 feet of movable gate section and 150 feet of non-submersible earthen dike. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2016 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 20 as low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from scour leading to dam instability, a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock, and miter gate failure due to operations in ice. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 20. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Berlin Dam across the Mahoning River in 1943 to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in the low-lying communities in the Mahoning River valley, including Newton Falls, Leavittsburg, Warren, and Niles, Ohio.  The dam is located about ten miles northeast of Alliance, Ohio and forms the Berlin Lake.  Berlin Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $2.8 billion since the start of operations. The reservoir stores rainfall to maintain downstream flow within the downstream riverbanks and releases water after flood events; provides water supply; and provides numerous opportunities for recreation.  Berlin Dam is composed of both a concrete portion and an earthen (embankment) portion with a maximum height of 96 feet and a length of about 5,750 feet.  The concrete portion of the dam has spillway gates designed to release a large volume of water during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.  The reservoir serves to store rainfall from spring through early summer to augment flow during the drier late summer and early autumn months, provides water supply to the Mahoning Valley Sanitary District, and can be used for recreational purposes.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Berlin Dam was completed in 2017, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as very low.  The dam was well-constructed and is well-maintained.  However, large populations live downstream of Berlin Dam, including those in Lake Milton, Craig Beach, Newton Falls, Leavittsburg, Warren, and Niles, Ohio, and other low-lying communities on the Mahoning and Beaver rivers. Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding \nto these communities, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from Berlin Dam would be a high-volume release over the dam\u2019s spillway during an unusually large and intense storm event.  Water released over the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam had not been constructed.  \n\nThere are less likely, but far more devastating flooding scenarios that exist.: An extreme rainfall event during which reservoir water flows over the spillway, could cause one of the dam segments to slide downstream, resulting in breach of the dam and release of the reservoir.  Although the extreme rainfall event would be unlikely to raise the reservoir to levels that would be higher than the embankment portions of the dam, water could be washed over the top of the embankment, causing the embankment to erode, resulting in breach of the dam and release of the reservoir. Finally, during an extreme rainfall event, the resulting high reservoir level could create high water pressure near the bottom of the embankment dam where it meets the concrete portion of the dam.  If this occurs, the soil at this location could erode and, if unchecked, the erosion could extend from the downstream side of the embankment upstream to the reservoir.  If this occurs, the area of erosion could grow to the point that the embankment dam breaches, and the reservoir drains rapidly. Although such a precipitation event leading to a breach is extremely rare, it is a possibility.\n\nIn any of these scenarios, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Communities, including Lake Milton, that are closer to the dam, are in more immediate danger of a significant flood event and may have little advanced warning.  Cities and communities further downstream of the dam, such as Niles, have larger populations and possibly less awareness of the dam but will have more warning. For the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, possibly overflowing the banks on the Mahoning and Beaver Rivers, destroying buildings and infrastructure.  Anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plans. We will study whether there are additional measures that we can take to reduce the risk of dam breach associated with high reservoir levels.  We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently during high-water events.  Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high-water event is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses.  We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current lake levels at the Berlin reservoir is available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttps://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/03090000/#dataTypeId=continuous-62615-0&period=P7D&showMedian=true",

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of W. Kerr Scott Dam in 1962 across the Yadkin River. Located 3.7 miles upstream of Wilkesboro, North Carolina, the dam is comprised of compacted earth that forms an embankment between two hillsides. The dam is almost 150 feet tall and approximately a third of a mile long and is operated and maintained by USACE. The dam reduces the risk of flooding to the Towns of Wilkesboro, North Wilkesboro, and other smaller downstream communities. Following large storms, flood waters accumulate in the reservoir and then USACE releases the water over time at non-damaging rates after downstream conditions improve (primarily based on river stages at Wilkesboro). USACE makes all decisions about releasing water from the reservoir using the Water Control Manual, created specifically for conditions in the Yadkin River Basin. USACE generally releases water from the reservoir through a concrete outlet tunnel. The dam also has an auxiliary spillway, an engineered 400-foot-wide notch in the nearby hillside on the north side of the dam, designed to divert water from the reservoir before it can flow over the top of the dam. To date, water levels have never reached high enough to flow through the auxiliary spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To minimize flood risks associated with W. Kerr Scott Dam, USACE utilizes the latest forecast and stream gauge information to predict precipitation, inflow, and outflow. USACE coordinates closely with the National Weather Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam. USACE works with these partners and local and state emergency management officials to prepare and practice for emergency response efforts. USACE provides local emergency managers and risk managers with detailed information about the dam and the potential worst-case scenario flood data, including flood depths and arrival times, so they can prepare for and act in a timely manner during an event. \n\nDuring high water events, USACE dam safety professionals continuously monitor the dam and are prepared to act if issues arise. USACE also regularly inspects the dam and routinely re-assesses the risks associated with the dam. Were a dam emergency to occur, USACE would be in constant communication with local and state emergency managers to ensure they can maximize time to alert and evacuate the public. USACE recently updated the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan to enhance these coordination efforts.\nUSACE has recently created a digital site characterization model to better understand the internal structure of the dam and has surveyed the top of the dam to determine presence and location of low spots along the crest. USACE also installed additional instrumentation to help with monitoring the condition of the dam.",

The name was later changed to J Percy Priest Dam in 1952 through Public Law 85-496.  The J. Percy Priest Dam and Lake are located in Davidson/Wilson/Rutherford Counties in Tennessee.  The dam is located 6.8 miles above the confluence with the Cumberland River, and approximately 23 river miles above the capital city of Nashville and controls a drainage area of 892 square miles.  The lake is approximately 42 miles long and has a surface area of 14,200 acres during summer pool.  The dam is a combination rolled earth fill and concrete gravity dam whose maximum height above streambed is 130 feet.  The total crest length of the dam is approximately 2,716 feet, 664 feet of which is attributed to the concrete portion.  The authorized purposes of the J. Percy Priest project are flood control, hydropower, and recreation, with additional operating purposes of fish and wildlife, water quality, and water supply.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Patoka Lake Dam in 1978. Patoka Lake Dam is located in southwestern Indiana, approximately 75 miles northwest of Louisville, Kentucky, and 12 miles northeast of Jasper, Indiana. The dam is located on the Patoka River, approximately 119 miles above the mouth of the Patoka River, a tributary of the Wabash River. The project consists of a 1550-foot-long earth and rock filled embankment with a maximum height of 145 feet, a gate-controlled outlet works, a 370-foot wide uncontrolled open-cut spillway, and a 1750-foot-long earth and rockfill dike. The project reduces flood damages approximately 118 miles along the Patoka River. The project has a drainage area above the dam of approximately 168 square miles. At spillway crest, the reservoir pool extends up the Patoka River a distance of approximately 31 miles. The record pool occurred in May 2011 where the pool elevation reached 549.7 feet, which is 1.7 feet above the spillway sill elevation of 547.62 feet NAVD88.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Patoka Lake Dam in June 2023 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4 which is considered Low relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam provides flood reduction to downstream communities. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding can still occur if a very large rainfall event were to result in unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway. There is also a very unlikely, but far more disastrous scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is internal erosion of the dam\u2019s and/or dike\u2019s embankment during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach of the dam. In this scenario, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along the Patoka River.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream communities. The largest impacts would be to the communities of Dubois, Jasper, and Patoka,  Indiana. Potentially impacted facilities include fire stations, police stations, water treatment plant, electrical substations and radio station located in Jasper. No critical facilities are expected to be impacted in Dubois or Patoka.",

Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly monitors on-site instruments and conducts regular inspections to ensure the health and integrity of the dam. The frequency of these inspections increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.

    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no estimated potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated.

In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nAlthough Black Rock Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Black Rock Dam is designed to manage peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Black Rock Dam through the ungated spillway during high water events. This type of water release occurs when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Water moving through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a four-story building. While weather can be unpredictable, this type of event can often be predicted 1-2 days before flood waters would impact downstream communities. USACE will engage state emergency managers when such an event is forecasted and support actions to get people to safety.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment in 2024 and classified the risks associated with the Black Rock Dam as low. This classification is based on the large population that lives immediately downstream of the dam in Thomaston, Connecticut, as well as along the Naugatuck and its tributaries, including towns between Waterbury and Stratford, Connecticut. Three unlikely, but more devastating scenarios that would produce significant downstream flooding are breach of the dam due to water flowing over the top of the dam; spillway erosion leading to breach of the dam; or embankment erosion leading to breach. In the case of an extremely rare and large rain event, water could potentially flow over the top of the dam, which could cause erosion of the earthen embankment, and breach of the dam. In addition, large spillway flows could cause erosion in the channel downstream and potentially undermine the spillway control structure leading to a breach of the spillway structure. Last, internal erosion of the embankment could create a flow path through the dam, which would eventually allow the crest to collapse.  In these scenarios, downstream flooding in Thomaston would occur just over an hour after of breach and the rapidly moving water could be as deep as a four-story structure, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nBlack Rock Dam is operated in conjunction with Thomaston Dam and Northfield Brook Dam, and is staffed full time.  During high pools, Black Rock Dam is inspected on a daily basis.   When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Crooked Creek Dam across Crooked Creek in Armstrong County in 1940 to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in the low-lying communities in the lower Allegheny Valley including Kittanning, Ford City, the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The dam forms the Crooked Creek Lake and is located about 7 miles upstream of the Allegheny River. The dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $600 million, since the start of operations in 1940. The reservoir stores rainfall to maintain downstream flow within the downstream riverbanks, releases water after flood events and provides numerous opportunities for recreation. Crooked Creek Dam is composed of an earthen (embankment) dam which has a maximum height of 143 feet and a length of 1,490 feet. The reservoir levels are managed to approved levels throughout the year, normally by means of water releases through a tunnel that discharges water to the downstream Crooked Creek. In order to reduce the possibility that the reservoir will overtop the dam, a  spillway (a concrete chute) was constructed to release a large volume of reservoir water away from the dam during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Crooked Creek Dam was completed in 2017, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as low. The dam was well-constructed and is well-maintained. However, large populations live downstream of Crooked Creek Dam, including those in Kittanning, Ford City, the greater Pittsburgh Area, and other low-lying communities on the Allegheny river. Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding to these communities, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from Crooked Creek Dam would be a high-volume release over the dam\u2019s spillway (which has never occurred since the dam began operations in 1940) during an unusually large and intense storm event.  Water released over the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam had not been constructed.\nA less likely, but far more devastating flooding scenario exists: during an extreme rainfall event, high water levels in the reservoir could cause high water pressure within the embankment dam or its foundation.  If this were to occur, the high-pressure water could erode the soils in the embankment dam or its foundation, which could lead to a breach of the dam. Although this scenario is very unlikely to occur, it is a possibility.\n\nIn either scenario, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Communities, including Kittanning and Ford City, that are closer to the dam, are in more immediate danger of a significant flood event and may have little advanced warning. Cities and communities further downstream of the dam, such as communities in metropolitan Pittsburgh have larger populations and possibly less awareness of the dam but will have more warning. \n\nWith either of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, possibly overflowing levees (including those in Kittanning, New Kensington, and the Pittsburgh metropolitan area in Pennsylvania), destroying buildings and infrastructure. Anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently during high-water events. Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high-water event is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current lake levels at the Crooked Creek Lake is available to the public via the internet at: \n\nhttps://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?03038500",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Grenada Dam in 1954 across the Yalobusha River and continues the ownership, maintenance, and operation of the facility today. The dam helps to control flooding along the Yazoo River Basin for more than 50,000 residents and more than 20,000 homes and businesses totaling nearly $3 Billion.  The dam also provides water-based and other outdoor recreational activities. The 80-foot-tall, earthen-filled dam is located three miles upstream of Grenada, MS and is approximately 13,900 feet (over 2.5 miles) long.  The Coffeeville Levee near Coffeeville, MS is a feature of the Grenada Dam Project, and it works to protect Coffeeville from Grenada Lake during high water events. Please refer to the Coffeeville Levee (NID ID: MS01494S001) for more information about that structure. \n\nGrenada Dam and Reservoir is managed throughout the year to store and slowly release water to help keep the Yalobusha River within its banks and to reduce the peak flow of rainfall runoff.  The lake is drawn down during the fall and winter months to provide needed storage for when rains are prevalent. The lake is allowed to fill during the spring and summer months to provide recreational opportunities to the visiting public. The lake is operated in this manner on a yearly basis following the Water Control Plan for the project.\n\nReservoir water is released through three gated outlet tunnels into the Yalobusha River. These outlets can release enough water to fill an Olympic size swimming pool in 8 seconds. The dam's emergency spillway is located on the south side of the dam and is designed to pass high volumes of flood waters to keep the dam from being overtopped and breaking.  In the unlikely event that water exceeds safe levels, the spillway would pass this water over a concrete rim and down a 200-foot wide concrete slope into the spillway outlet channel and eventually back into the Yalobusha River.  This emergency spillway can release enough water to fill an Olympic size swimming pool in 2 seconds.  Grenada Lake has overflowed the emergency spillway 6 times since the dam was constructed. The most recent overflow occurred in 2020.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Grenada Dam significantly reduces flood risks for downstream communities, it does not eliminate them. Large, rare storm events can produce more rainfall than the dam and reservoir can safely store, resulting in the need for large water releases or activation of the spillway to prevent overtopping and failure. These releases can cause downstream flooding, particularly in low-lying and agricultural areas along the Yalobusha and Yazoo River systems.\n\nThe most recent Periodic Assessment, completed by USACE in accordance with ER 1110-2-1156, evaluated several potential failure modes (PFMs) for Grenada Dam and the associated Coffeeville Levee. The assessment identified two primary risk drivers at the dam: Backward erosion piping at the outlet works, which could result in loss of material and threaten the stability of the structure, and Uplift pressure under the stilling basin slab, which could damage outlet components and lead to uncontrolled releases.\n\nAlthough the likelihood of these failure modes occurring is considered remote, their consequences could include downstream flooding and potential loss of life, especially near low-lying communities such as Grenada and Coffeeville. Continued monitoring and mitigation efforts are essential to maintaining public safety.\n\nThe Coffeeville Levee was assessed as a low-risk (DSAC 5) structure. The primary concern is overtopping during extreme flood events. Although no loss of life is expected under such a scenario, prolonged flooding of the town and surrounding areas could occur.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Grenada Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing pool conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. USACE has made interim repairs to the drainage system, outlet channel, and toe ditch to reduce risk of failure.",

    "projectDescription": "White Rock Dam is a high hazard potential dam located on the Bois de Sioux River at the north end of Lake Traverse, near White Rock, South Dakota. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed White Rock Dam in 1939 - 1941.  The flood control Act of 1936 describes Lake Traverse as a: \"Reservoir for flood protection of agricultural communities, water conservation, and other incidental benefits; special report on record in the Office of the Chief of Engineers.\" The \u2018special report\u2019 defines the project consisting of: \"a. A flood control reservoir at Lake Traverse [i.e. White Rock Dam] created by a dam across the Bois de Sioux Valley.....b. A water conservation reservoir in Lake Traverse [Reservation Dam] south of the Reservation Highway, created by the highway dike and control works at the Reservation Bridge.  c. A dike at the southern end of the reservoir [Browns Valley Dike] to prevent floodwaters stored in the lake from overflowing...., and d. Channel improvement of the Bois de Sioux River downstream from the White Rock Dam for a distance of about 24 miles.\"   The conservation pool is primarily maintained by Reservation dam located about 7 miles south of White Rock Dam and operated jointly as one project.  White Rock Dam will store enough water to submerge Reservation Dam during large floods. Both are adjusted seasonally for recreation, fish & wildlife, water quality, water conservation, and water supply.  Flood control is maximized by reservoir drawn down to provide storage for anticipated snowmelt runoff. Flood events may occur throughout the year, particularly during spring snowmelt and summer storms.  The main components of the project are an earthen embankment, and a combined gated spillway and outlet structure.  The earthen dam is 2-1/2 miles long and a maximum 16 feet high, and the elevation of the top of the earthen embankment is 986.6 feet NAVD88.",
    "riskCharSummary": "White Rock Dam is hydrologically inadequate, although the risks are low. USACE completed a Dam Safety Assurance Program (DSAP) Evaluation Report, approved December 2004.  The DSAP report found that White Rock Dam can safely contain (with freeboard) only 9% of the PMF. The PMF is the current spillway design flood standard for high hazard dams used to assess project risks associated with hydrologic deficiencies.  White Rock impounds a total storage capacity of about 250,000 acre-feet at flood control (elevation 981.4) and about 350,000 acre-feet at top of embankment elevation 986.6 (including water impounded above Reservation dam).  The gated spillway is designed to discharge 5600 cubic feet per second at conservation pool and up to about 10,000 cfs at the embankment crest; while the peak inflow rate for the probable maximum flood (PMF) event is 179,000 cubic-feet per second.   Water cannot be released fast enough to prevent the dam from overtopping during extreme events. \n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment for White Rock Dam in 2023 that characterizes the risk associated with the project as Low.  The risk is primarily driven by low consequences since a dam breach would spread over the red river valley with low flood depths.   Failure scenarios considered hydrologic inadequacy leading to embankment overtopping.   The risk assessment considered that significant discharge may pass over the embankment without breach due to the long length of embankment, the clay embankment with paved crest is scour resistant, and tailwater effects reduce scour at the embankment toe.  An incipient overtopping event is at an annual exceedance probability of about once in 800 \u2013 900 years. There is potential for overtopping discharges or breach risk considerations to complicate flood operations of the Fargo-Moorhead Flood Risk Management project that may be worth further evaluation.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To manage dam safety risks, USACE has a routine program that inspects and monitors its dams regularly and implements short- and long-term actions on a prioritized basis when unacceptable risks are found at any of its dams. The 2004 DSAP report proposed armoring the embankment for overtopping, but no remediation has been funded since consequences are small.  Current hydraulic models show that life safety is only a concern at the full PMF extreme event scenario.  Model estimates for loss of life are near zero for lesser flood scenarios.  Life safety and economic consequences derived from inundation mapping are mostly in Breckenridge, Wahpeton, and Fargo.  These communities all have flood risk management projects completed or in progress since the 2004 DSAP report.  A downstream flood wave from a dam breach is attenuated quickly in the Red River floodplain.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Chouteau Lock and Dam in 1970 with the primary purpose for navigation of the lower Arkansas River Basin.  Chouteau Lock and Dam also provides fish and wildlife habitat and recreation benefits. The project consists of a concrete gated spillway flanked on each side by earthen embankments and a navigation lock chamber that allows barge traffic carrying various goods to pass up and down the river.  Chouteau Lock and Dam 17 is located in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, about 4 miles west of Okay and about 7 miles north of Muskogee.  The lock is on the Verdigris River, a tributary to the Arkansas River.  Chouteau Lock and Dam 17 is about 50 miles downstream from the Port of Catoosa, Oklahoma, and about 27 miles downstream from Newt Graham Lock & Dam, the uppermost lock and dam in the system.  Under normal river conditions, the flows within the river are regulated by the concrete gated spillway to ensure river levels are high enough for navigation barge traffic.  During river flooding, the spillway gates are fully opened to allow as much water to pass through the structure as possible.  After the flood passes and the river level recedes, the project returns to normal river conditions.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in June 2015 and classified the risk associated with Chouteau Lock and Dam as low.  Although extremely unlikely, the primary risk to the integrity of the lock and dam is the potential for erosion of the rock foundation at the spillway to lead to failure.  Failure of the dam would include a disruption to navigation and economic impacts.  Widespread flooding could occur downstream as part of normal operation of the dam (when the gates are fully opened during a large flood). A large increase in downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail as the dam is not designed or operated to reduce downstream flooding, but instead for navigation purposes.  For a large flood along the river the biggest impacts would be to the cities of Fort Gibson, Muskogee, and other communities along the Arkansas River.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk that Chouteau Lock and Dam poses to downstream communities and those that rely on river navigation. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal river levels and during and after flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has an instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.  Lastly, the navigation lock chamber is periodically dewatered for inspection and repairs.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Oologah Dam in 1969 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Oologah Dam is located on the Verdigris River about 8 miles northwest of Tulsa. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  This stored water can then be released in a more controlled manner to reduce dangerous flooding downstream.  These releases are regulated by a discharge conduit through the earthen dam and a concrete gated spillway, located east of the earthen dam.  Oologah Dam helps to regulate flows along the Verdigris River which benefits navigation along the Arkansas River and the Port of Catoosa.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2024 and classified the risk associated with Oologah Dam as low. The primary risk identified is the potential for water to seep through the embankment near the outlet conduits to lead to erosion and breach.  Failure of the dam would include catastrophic flooding downstream and widespread economic impacts and significant loss of life. In the remote event of a dam failure, the largest impacts would be to the cities of Claremore, Collinsville, Owasso, Verdigris, Tulsa, Jenks (including those areas behind the Jenks Levee System), and other communities along the Arkansas River. Bridges crossing the Verdigris River and key infrastructure along the river from Oologah to Webbers Falls could also be damaged or destroyed, including operation and access of the Kerr-McClellan Navigational System.\n\nThere are also operational risks associated with planned gate releases during a flood event at Oologah Dam. While flooding would be less than a breach scenario, life loss and significant economic impacts could still occur due to the possible extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk that Oologah Dam poses to downstream communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Stockton Dam, completing in 1969. Stockton Dam is located at river mile 49.5 on the Sac River in Cedar County, Missouri, about two miles east of the town of Stockton. Downstream of the dam are Roscoe, MO and Osceola, MO. The dam was authorized for flood control, hydroelectric power, fish & wildlife enhancement, recreation, water quality, and water supply. Stockton Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $442 million (2024 price level) from 1970 to 2021. Average annual water supply benefit is approximately $26 million. The dam is 5,600 feet long composed of compacted earth and rock fill embankment. Between the left abutment and the spillway is a 106-feet-wide concrete powerhouse. The spillway consists of a 184-feet-wide concrete ogee crest with four Tainter gates to control releases of water alongside the powerhouse. Additionally, two rim dike structures complete the reservoir rim.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Stockton Dam in March 2022 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low.  Risks include internal erosion of embankment materials during rare flood events. USACE is confident the foundation was thoroughly prepared, and the dam was correctly built and will continue to be well maintained to reduce the flood risk to downstream communities.  \n\nUSACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed the Stockton Lake storage capacity require USACE to release water through spillway gates, even if the river is at or beyond capacity, to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam. This can result in flooding at downstream areas. If an even more extreme flood event occurs, inflows into the reservoir may exceed the storage and release capacity of the dam, and overtopping may occur. If overtopping occurs the earthen embankment portion of dam could erode leading to a sudden release of water downstream. This could result in deadly flooding in Caplinger Mills, Missouri, Osceola, MO and all along Harry S. Truman Reservoir.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Red Rock Dam in May 1959 for the purposes of flood risk management, water quality, recreation, and fish and wildlife management. A non-Federal hydropower facility was constructed at the dam and placed into service in 2020. Red Rock Dam is located on the Des Moines River about 4 miles southwest of the City of Pella, Iowa. The earthen dam is about 1.2 miles long with a maximum height of 110 feet. A concrete water control structure is located near the middle of the dam and provides the means for water to be released from the lake. Water can be released through the water control structure in three ways. The first is through the non-Federal hydropower facility with the capacity to release up to 10,200 cfs when the lake is between elevation 740 feet and 762 feet. The second is through a series of 14 sluice gates that can release up to 39,000 cfs when the lake is below elevation 770 feet. The third is through a series of 5 Tainter gates that can release more than 130,000 cfs when the lake is above elevation 770 feet. Red Rock Dam has prevented over $1.6 billion in flood damages and protects more than 27,000 people living and working in the area below the dam. The highest lake elevation observed was in 1993 and was just under 15 feet lower than the top of the dam with releases through the dam of 130,000 cubic feet per second.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2022 and classified the risk associated with Red Rock Dam as low. Water released from the dam would impact the cities and towns along the Des Moines River downstream of the dam to the Mississippi River in the extremely unlikely event of a dam failure. The dam was found to be well-designed, well-constructed, and well-maintained and is expected to be reliable during major floods. However, there is a very remote risk of dam failure from extremely high lake levels overtopping the dam or the dissolving of minerals beneath the dam\u2019s foundation leading to sinkholes. Although highly unlikely, a dam failure would produce a devastating flood with flood depths greater than 15 feet along the river through cities and towns such as Ottumwa and Keosauqua, Iowa to the confluence with the Mississippi River at Keokuk, Iowa. The flood would inundate the cities and towns within the floodplain along the Des Moines River and overtop levees along the Mississippi River south of Hannibal, Missouri. Approximately 27,000 people live or work within the worst-case inundation area of the flooding caused by a dam failure.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Red Rock Dam. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 response plan and evacuation procedures. Dam breach flood maps are available for public viewing on the National Inventory of Dams. USACE is developing a detailed communication plan based on the latest risk assessment findings and will engage in communication activities with state and local representatives, stakeholders, emergency managers, and the general public to increase awareness. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing lake levels. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal and high lake levels to ensure the integrity of the dam, identify deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. Lastly, the Des Moines River Master Reservoir Regulation Manual, Water Control Manual for Lake Red Rock was updated in coordination with upstream and downstream stakeholders, to allow the lake to be better managed in terms of earlier reservoir releases ahead of increasing lake levels to prevent large operational releases.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Monroe Lake Dam in 1965. The Monroe Lake project is located in south-central Indiana, approximately 58 air miles southwest of Indianapolis, Indiana, and 10 miles south of Bloomington, Indiana. The project authorized function includes flood risk management, water supply and recreation. The project consists of a 1,350-foot-long earth-filled embankment with a maximum height of 93 feet, a gate-controlled outlet works along the base of the right abutment, and an open-cut spillway through the left abutment. The project reduces flood damages along approximately 26 miles of Salt Creek, approximately 92 miles on the East Fork of the White River, and 52 miles of the White River before its confluence with the Wabash River. The lake has a drainage area of approximately 441 square miles. At spillway crest (El. 555.59 ft-NAVD88), the reservoir extends up Salt Creek approximately 43 miles. The record pool elevation is 556.89 ft-NAVD88 which occurred in May of 2011.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Monroe Lake Dam in March 2018 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 5 which is considered Very Low relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not eliminate the risk completely. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to result in unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway. There is also a very unlikely, but far more disastrous scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is erosion of the dam\u2019s embankment during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach of the dam. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along Salt Creek and the White River.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream areas. Communities in Monroe, Lawrence and Martin Counties in Indiana are most impacted by downstream flooding scenarios with slight impacts further downstream in Dubois, Pike, and Davies Counties in Indiana. The areas are primarily rural and consists of moderately rugged terrain primarily used for farming. The largest impacts would be to the cities of Oolitic on Salt Creek; Bedford, and Shoals on the East Fork of the White River; and low-lying areas around Petersburg on the White River. Impacts after the confluence with the Wabash River would be equivalent to seasonal flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather Service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The Conchas Dam project is owned and operated by the Albuquerque District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The project includes a dam located on the Canadian River in San Miguel County, New Mexico.  Construction was completed in 1948 and primary project features include a combination concrete gravity dam with zoned earthen embankments; gated outlet works to adjust operational water releases into the Canadian River; gated irrigation headworks to allow controlled releases for irrigation demand; and two spillways to pass much larger, uncontrolled flows during extreme events.  One spillway is a concrete weir located separate from the primary concrete and earthen dam and the other is integral to the concrete gravity dam.  During flood events, the Conchas dam project can be operated for flood risk reduction on its own or in conjunction with other dams to optimize upstream and downstream flood risks within the Canadian River basin.  In addition to the project\u2019s main purpose to provide flood risk reduction, it is also authorized for sediment retention, irrigation, and recreation benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although the Conchas Dam project has successfully reduced flooding, it does not eliminate all flood risk caused by rainfall downstream of the dam or due to emergency operation of the project.  During infrequent emergency operations, larger required releases passing through the project\u2019s gated outlet works could surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Canadian River to Ute Dam.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled spillway flow has never occurred, uncontrolled flow through the spillways would greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Canadian River, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including State Highways 433 and 104) along the Canadian River to Ute Dam.  \n\nA screening level risk assessment of the Conchas Dam project was completed in 2009.  Preliminary results characterized dam breach risk as LOW due to the combination of life loss consequences and low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the result of an extreme event.  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation could be life-threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including State Highways 433 and 104) along the Canadian River to Ute Dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquake or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities include maintenance of mechanical equipment and sediment removal.  Future risk communication activities include revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and development of a formal risk communication plan.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed the construction of Dewey Dam and Brandykeg Dike in 1950. The project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938 and is designed for flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement. Dewey Dam is a high hazard potential dam on Johns Creek located approximately 5.4 miles upstream of its confluence with the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, approximately 14 river miles upstream of Paintsville, Kentucky, and 13 river miles downstream of Prestonsburg, Kentucky. \n\nDewey Dam is an earth-fill embankment dam with a maximum height of 118 feet and length of 913 feet. One unregulated emergency spillway is located to the left of the dam (looking downstream).  Another unregulated emergency spillway is located 4 miles upstream of the dam.  Water would pass through these during extreme flood events to prevent the dam from overtopping.  Flood damages prevented by Dewey Dam are about $1.4 billion over the project life (from 1949 to 2021) and average about $22.4 million annually. Like most high hazard potential dams that the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers manage, a breach of Dewey Dam would lead to loss of life and/or high economic impacts downstream.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dewey Dam and Brandykeg Dike significantly reduce the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, they do not eliminate the risk entirely. Although the dam and dike have historically performed well, extreme rainfall events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam and dike operate as intended, downstream flooding can still occur in a very large rainfall event. This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and spillways. In extreme cases, this flooding could be like what was experienced prior to the dam's construction.  \n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Dewey Dam and Brandykeg Dike in 2023 and classified the risk associated with failure as Low and Very Low, respectively. The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the activation of both spillways would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping or potentially breaching.  \n\nWhile the spillways have never flowed, operation of one or both of them could result in significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply. Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along Johns Creek, Levisa Fork, and the Big Sandy River may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows.\n\nAlthough the odds of such a storm event occurring are considered extremely unlikely, Dewey Dam has an Emergency Action Plan to outline personnel responses to anticipated emergency scenarios. In the unlikely event this occurs, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Dewey Dam and Brandykeg Dike. The project is well-maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam and dike during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders supports and strengthens risk management and successful emergency response actions. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated and flood fighting materials are stored on site to improve the ability to successfully respond in an emergency.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Allegheny River Lock and Dam 6 across the Allegheny River in 1928.  The dam is located near Clinton, Pennsylvania, about 36 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Allegheny River Lock and Dam 7, which is located near Kittanning, Pennsylvania.  The dam consists of a concrete spillway section, which means that the river flows freely over it.  The lock provides a lift of about 12 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream ends.  The upper pool created by the dam provides recreation opportunities and water for nearby communities.  The dam also provides hydropower at the plant located in line with the dam near the left bank.  The combined benefits from shipping materials and goods, hydropower, water supply, and recreation amount to about 1 million dollars annually. There are no means of controlling the flow over the dam and the dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam, which was performed in 2021, characterized the risk as very low, because there is no potential for life loss or significant economic damages in the unlikely event that the dam fails.  Although the dam holds back water, failure of Allegheny Lock and Dam 6 will not result in the flooding of downstream communities. \n\nIf the upper pool of the dam is released due to a dam failure, river navigation would be halted, resulting in a loss of economic benefits to the region of about 1 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping, hydropower generation, and boat recreation.  Although this scenario is possible, the project has performed well for over 90 years without incident or indications that this scenario is occurring.  Due to the relatively low height of the dam, which lies entirely within the banks of the Allegheny River, downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communication and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam or that may adversely affect navigation.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications.  We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Libby Dam in 1973. The dam is located on the Kootenai River (part of the international Columbia River system), approximately 17 miles upstream of Libby, Montana. The dam is a concrete structure with a spillway and stilling basin used to release large flows during extreme flood events. Other features include a powerhouse, visitor\u2019s center, and two downstream campgrounds. Libby Dam reduces downstream flood risk for Libby, Troy, and Bonner\u2019s Ferry by storing water during major flood events. In addition to flood risk management, the project\u2019s purposes also include power generation, recreation, navigation, and fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Libby Dam in May 2024 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as moderate due to earthquake hazards that may create a rockslide into the reservoir generating a wave overtopping the dam or an earthquake displacing the concrete structure of the dam causing a sudden release of water downstream. The latter would result in deadly flooding in Libby, Troy, and Bonner\u2019s Ferry. Although this failure scenario is considered unlikely, USACE maintains a Libby Dam Emergency Action Plan to lower the risk of life loss and property damage if this or other potential failure scenarios occurred.\n\nUSACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate flooding. Extreme snowmelt and rainfall events require USACE to release rising water through the dam\u2019s spillway to prevent overtopping and failure of the dam and to balance flood risk to the reservoir upstream. This can result in flooding areas downstream.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce risks to life safety and property, including the current on-going risk evaluation study. USACE conducts regular inspections and maintains a network of instruments to monitor the health of the dam. The frequency of inspections increases when conditions change to confirm whether the structure is performing as designed and identify areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Rainfall and snowpack forecasts are continuously monitored to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood operations and associated warnings. USACE also works closely with local emergency managers to annually update the Emergency Action Plan, conducts periodic emergency exercises with state and local response teams, and annually hosts water control information stakeholder meetings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Inundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.  More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Granger Dam in 1980 in accordance with Flood Control Act approved September 1954 (Public Law 780, 83rd Congress, 2nd Session), and in accordance with the plan of improvement and with the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers outlined in House Document No. 535 (81st Congress, 2nd Session). In conjunction, North Fork and South Fork Reservoirs were also authorized in 1962 for construction. Granger Dam, formerly known as Laneport Reservoir, was built on the San Gabriel River to reduce the risk of flooding to mostly rural areas within 60 miles downstream of the dam, including the City of Cameron, Texas, adjacent towns and counties, and the downstream Texas cities of Sugarland and Freeport, which are located approximately 258 to 350 miles downstream. Granger Dam is located 10 miles northeast of the City of Taylor in Williamson County, Texas and reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities by holding back waters during heavy rain events until they can be released minimizing loss of life, property or the environment. The dam consists of an earthen embankment that holds water in the reservoir, hydraulic slide gates that are operated to release water in a regulated manner during and after flood events, and an uncontrolled ogee weir spillway which holds water to 27\u2010feet below the top of the dam to allow water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir become high. The main dam is made up of soil and rock and is approximately 115 feet high (approximately 12 stories) at a crest elevation of 555.0 feet (NGVD29 vertical datum control). Excluding the spillway, the dam embankment is approximately 15,425.5 feet long. The reservoir is kept at or below the conservation pool elevation of 504.0 feet NGVD29 for most of the year. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir and released in accordance with the water control manual. Granger Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam also provides water supply, fish and wildlife conservation, and unique recreation opportunities. These benefits all significantly improve the quality of life in the area.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Even though Granger Dam reduces the risk of flooding to the downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. USACE Fort Worth District completed a risk assessment for Granger Dam in May 2017 that characterizes the risk associated with the project as very low. This classification is based on an unlikely event involving internal erosion of foundation gravels under the right abutment embankment of the auxiliary spillway and overtopping of the dam during extreme flooding events. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Granger Dam are high volume releases through the uncontrolled overflow spillway during significant storm events. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions like how the river might behave if the dam did not exist. In the remote event of a dam breach, the largest impacts would be mostly in rural areas located within 60 miles of the dam and in the Cities of Laneport, San Gabriel, and Cameron, Texas. Although these communities have local emergency managers meeting regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response planning to flood events, including the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would likely result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To lower the risks associated with the dam, inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the dam is safely and properly performing. Surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Routine maintenance and dam safety monitoring are performed to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. USACE Fort Worth District annually inspects and monitors instruments that help ensure that the structure is performing as intended and help detect potential concerns. USACE Fort Worth District also works closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize time for evacuation and designating evacuation routes; annually updates the Granger Dam Emergency Action Plan; conducts emergency exercises with state and local response teams; and annually communicates risks associated with Granger Dam with stakeholders and Emergency Managers.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Winfield Locks and Dam in 2020 and classified the risk associated with failure as low. \n\nInundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Mojave River Dam in 1971 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities along the Mojave River, including Hesperia, Apple Valley, Victorville and Barstow in San Bernardino County, California. The dam is located adjacent to the Pacific Crest Trail and where the West Fork Mojave River and Deep Creek join and form the Mojave River. Mojave River Dam is an earthen embankment and contains one outlet structure and a large concrete lined spillway with a 200 feet long crest. There are no gates on the dam because it is not designed to stop water; it is only designed to slow down the water's velocity to reduce the potential for out-of-channel flooding. There is typically no pool. The dam continues to operate as it was designed and reduces flood risk for more than 16,000 people and $1.5 billion in property.",
    "riskCharSummary": "In 2018, USACE completed a risk assessment of Mojave River Dam and reclassified the risk associated with the dam as \"High\". Although Mojave River Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam doesn't eliminate the risk of flooding. \n\nThere are two unlikely scenarios that could result in downstream flooding. One scenario is that a significant rainfall event in the watershed that drains to the dam produces enough runoff that it fills the reservoir and then continues to pass significant volumes of water through the ungated spillway. This spillway serves to protect the integrity of the dam, but it can pass enough water to cause damaging flooding in downstream communities. The second, more unlikely but far more devastating scenario is an extreme rainfall event that results in water flowing over the earthen dam, which erodes the dam and causes it to breach. An uncontrolled surge of water would inundate downstream communities with higher flood depths. Both scenarios could produce enough floodwater to destroy buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. If the dam breached, the water depth, property damage and lives lost would likely be far greater.  \n\nAdditionally, the local conditions contribute to the \"High\" risk classification. The mountains and steep hills upstream of the Mojave River Dam means precipitation runs downstream rapidly and  rivers rise quickly. Furthermore, storms in this region can be intense and localized, so it could be raining heavily in the mountains, but the weather could be sunny and dry in lowland areas, like in Apple Valley, Victorville, Hesperia and Barstow. If these conditions cause flooding downstream of the dam, the communities could be unprepared for flooding.\n\nThe communities downstream of the dam \u201c Hesperia, Apple Valley and Victorville\u201c are in a greater danger from deep and fast moving water in the event of a flood. Communities further downstream, including Oro Grande, Helendale, Barstow, Daggett, Yermo, Newberry Springs, Harvard and Baker \u201c which is about 140 miles downstream of the dam\"  could also see property damage; however, those communities would have longer warning times in the event that an evacuation is needed.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure USACE is taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises and incorporating any new information into our emergency action plan. USACE closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. USACE is working with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents and schools to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood. Additionally, USACE is implementing temporary measures to reduce the risk of water flowing over the top of the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Joe Pool Dam in May 1986. It is located at river mile 11.2 of Mountain Creek, a tributary to the West Fork of the Trinity River, near Grand Prairie, Texas. The authorized project\u2019s purpose is flood control, water supply, general recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement. The dam is an earthen embankment over four miles long and consists of the following three parts: a 108-foot-tall main embankment, which is used to retain the water for the lake; an outlet works, which includes lifting gates and a pipe through the dam used to regulate water releases and water storage; and an ungated spillway, which allows water to flow out when lake levels exceed the available flood storage. The ungated spillway is a safety measure to prevent lake levels from overflowing the top of the dam in extreme flood events. It is also important because it directs how and where water is released. The reservoir is kept at or below the conservation pool elevation for most of the year. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir until the swollen streams and rivers below the dam recede and can handle the release of stored water minimizing loss of life, property, and negative impacts to the environment. Sometimes water must be released to protect the dam\u2019s integrity even though these streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Joe Pool Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding due to floodwaters passed through the dam is high volume releases from Joe Pool Dam through the ungated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Joe Pool Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. Despite the flood reduction benefits the dam provides, very rare, severe storms could still produce high reservoir levels impacting the lake adjacent communities of Arlington, Mansfield, and Cedar Hill and result in surcharge releases with the potential to exceed the capacity of the downstream channels and impact the communities of Grand Prairie, Irving, and Dallas, putting thousands of people at risk.\n\nIn January 2021, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment to evaluate the potential hazards to the dam, expected performance, and associated consequences. The risk assessment classified risks associated with Joe Pool Dam as moderate. This classification is based on the potential for high life loss and consequences due to unlikely, but a far more devastating scenario than presented above that would produce significant flooding. Risk for Joe Pool Dam is driven by an extremely unlikely flood event, unlike anything ever experienced in the area, resulting in water flowing over the top of the dam, potentially leading to erosion of the embankment and an eventual dam breach. In the remote event of a dam breach, downstream flood waters would be deep and travel down Mountain Creek, over Mountain Creek Lake Dam (NID ID TX00827) and to the confluence with the Trinity River through Dallas County, including downtown Dallas, TX, located approximately 17 miles downstream of the dam. In this unlikely scenario, downstream flooding in Dallas, TX would occur within 6.5 hours of breach, overtopping federal levees, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure such as police and fire stations, schools, and emergency medical facilities. In addition, some evacuation routes would be inundated, increasing evacuation distances. Although the large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans; local emergency managers who meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events; and local emergency managers who are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, if a breach of the dam were to occur, it would result in severe economic damages and thousands of people\u2019s lives would be at risk within the inundated area.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes. The USACE Emergency Action Plan for Joe Pool Dam is updated and exercised annually, improving emergency response and coordination between USACE elements and downstream federal, state, county, city agencies, and stakeholders. USACE also communicates risks associated with Joe Pool Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers. Inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam, and surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Joe Pool Dam has experienced several slope failures, a condition where the soil slides downhill, on the upstream and downstream portions of the dam embankment; repairs are being prioritized and completed according to the risk they pose to the project. The performance of Joe Pool Dam is also monitored by an instrumentation system allowing USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as conducting regular surveillance of the dam, coordinating with local agencies to improve emergency response, assessing the current instrumentation program, and stockpiling materials for emergency flood fighting. Risk management of Joe Pool Dam is a priority for USACE at the national level which has led to higher level assessments in recent years. To understand the circumstances related to the concerns raised during a prior risk assessment, USACE conducted a more detailed analysis of the flood risks associated with the dam which will be continued on during an upcoming study to determine if any improvements to the dam are needed and evaluate various options for repairing the dam.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Hulah Dam in 1951 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities. The dam consists of an earthen embankment and a concrete gated spillway. Hulah Dam is located on the Caney River, a tributary of the larger Verdigris River watershed, about 15 miles northwest of Bartlesville, OK. The releases are regulated by ten large gates within the concrete spillway. Hulah Dam also provides additional benefits including water supply, water quality, fish and wildlife habitats, and recreation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Hulah Dam in 2023 and classified the risk associated with the dam as low.  The risk is primarily driven by the potential for water seeping through the foundation soils beneath the embankment leading to erosion and failure.  Another risk identified is the potential for water to flow over the embankment crest during a very extreme flood event resulting in embankment erosion and breach.  Failure of the dam would include catastrophic flooding downstream with widespread economic impacts and significant loss of life.  In the remote event of a dam failure, the largest impacts would be to the cities of Dewey, Bartlesville, Tulsa, Claremore, Muskogee, and other communities along the Arkansas and Caney Rivers.  Key infrastructure from Avant to Webbers Falls could also be damaged or destroyed.\n\nA more likely flooding scenario includes a large release through the gated spillway during a flood with the project operating as intended.  Although the inundation would not be as great as a breach of the dam this scenario could still result in widespread economic impacts and loss of life due to the potential extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk Hulah Dam poses to downstream communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. These instruments are monitored regularly for any early indications of potential safety concerns at the project.",

    "projectDescription": "Reservation Dam is a low hazard potential dam located on the Bois de Sioux River within Lake Traverse, near White Rock, South Dakota. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed Reservation Dam in 1939 - 1941.  The flood control Act of 1936 describes Lake Traverse as a: \"Reservoir for flood protection of agricultural communities, water conservation, and other incidental benefits; special report on record in the Office of the Chief of Engineers.\" The \u2018special report\u2019 defines the project consisting of: \"a. A flood control reservoir at Lake Traverse [i.e. White Rock Dam] created by a dam across the Bois de Sioux Valley.....b. A water conservation reservoir in Lake Traverse [Reservation Dam] south of the Reservation Highway, created by the highway dike and control works at the Reservation Bridge.  c. A dike at the southern end of the reservoir [Browns Valley Dike] to prevent floodwaters stored in the lake from overflowing...., and d. Channel improvement of the Bois de Sioux River downstream from the White Rock Dam for a distance of about 24 miles.\"   The conservation pool is primarily maintained by Reservation dam located about 7 miles south of White Rock Dam and operated jointly as one project.  White Rock Dam will store enough water to submerge Reservation Dam during large floods. Both are adjusted seasonally for recreation, fish & wildlife, water quality, water conservation, and water supply.  Flood control is provided by White Rock Dam, not Reservation. The main components of Reservation Dam are an earthen embankment, and a combined gated spillway and outlet structure.  The Reservation earthen dam is about 2-1/2 miles long and the elevation of the top of the earthen embankment is 981.4 feet NAVD88.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Reservation has very little risk attributed to downstream flood hazards since is it is essentially a dam within the reservoir created by White Rock Dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To manage dam safety risks, USACE has a routine program that inspects and monitors its dams regularly and implements short- and long-term actions on a prioritized basis when unacceptable risks are found at any of its dams. Reservation dam is occasionally closed to traffic during flood conditions.  Road closures have usually been in the spring snow melt period.  Reservoir levels within one foot of the road have occurred in July 1993, April 1995, April 1997, April 2001, March 2009, April 2010, April 2011, and April 2019.",

    "projectDescription": "The Two Rivers Dam project is owned and operated by the Albuquerque District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The project includes two dams:  Diamond A Dam located on the Rio Hondo and Rocky Dam located on Rocky Arroyo \u2013 the two watercourses converge approximately seven miles downstream of the project.  The project is in Chaves County, NM, about 20 miles from the Rio Hondo confluence with the Pecos River at the city of Roswell.  Construction was completed in 1963 and primary project features include two zoned earthen embankment dams, a gated outlet works in Diamond A Dam to adjust operational water releases into the Rio Hondo; an ungated outlet works in Rocky Dam to pass intermittent flows of Rocky Arroyo; and two spillways to pass much larger, uncontrolled flows during extreme events.  During flood events, the Two Rivers Dam project can be operated on its own or in conjunction with other dams to optimize upstream and downstream flood risk reduction in the Pecos River Basin.  In addition to the project\u2019s main purpose to provide flood risk reduction, it is also authorized for sediment detention.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although the Two Rivers Dam project has successfully reduced flooding, it does not eliminate all flood risk caused by rain downstream of the dam or due to emergency operation of the project.  During infrequent emergency operation, larger required releases through the project\u2019s gated outlet works or larger flows passing through the ungated outlet works could surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Rio Hondo and Pecos River to Fort Sumner Lake.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled spillway flows have never occurred, flow through the spillways could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Rio Hondo and Pecos River, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flows could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) downstream along the Rio Hondo and Pecos River to Brantley Lake.  Impacted communities include the cities of Roswell, Midway, Dexter, and Hagerman.\n\nUSACE conducted a risk assessment of the Two Rivers Dam project in 2016.  Preliminary assessment results characterize dam breach risk as MODERATE due to the combination of unacceptable life loss consequences and moderate likelihood of a dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the consequence of an extreme event.  Specifically, the occurrence of dam breach caused by foundation solutioning accompanied by erosion or collapse of either Diamond A or Rocky Dam was identified as the consequence of an extreme storm event (1 in 22,000 year or 0.0045% per year).  The annual probability of dam breach due to foundation solutioning scenarios caused by an extreme event is estimated to be moderate (1 in 10,000) or less.  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation would be life-threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) downstream along the Rio Hondo and Pecos River to Brantley Lake.  Impacted communities include the cities of Roswell, Midway, Dexter, and Hagerman.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquakes or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included minor erosion repairs and road grading, vegetation removal from the embankments and upstream reservoir area; and debris removal from the trash racks to allow unobstructed flow through the conduit during both routine and high flow events.  A building was recently constructed on Diamond A Dam to protect electrical and mechanical equipment and gate painting has been recommended.  Future risk communication activities include revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and development of a formal risk communication plan.  Flood warnings to notify affected communities downstream of the project are coordinated with external entities.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Whitney Dam in April 1951 in accordance with the Flood Control Act, approved on 18 August 1941 (Public Law 228, Seventy-Seventh Congress, first session), and completion of the project was authorized by the Flood Control Act approved 22 December 1944 (Public Law 534, Seventy-eighth Congress, second session). It is located approximately 5.5 miles southwest of the City of Whitney in Hill and Bosque Counties, Texas. The dam reduces the risk of downstream flooding along the Brazos River by holding back waters during heavy rain events. The dam is an earthen dam, approximately 3.35 miles long, with both a gated concrete spillway and a hydropower plant on the southern end. The gated spillway is controlled by seventeen tainter gates that hold water to 9 feet below the top of the dam to regulate water storage and releases. The gated spillway also contains sixteen low-flow gated sluiceways, or openings through the dam, for releasing water in a regulated manner during and after flood events. The hydropower plant can produce 21,500 kilowatts of energy through two 16-foot diameter pipes. Additional benefits of the dam are recreation and fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Whitney Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Whitney Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment in July 2016 and classified the risks associated with the project as low. This classification is based on an extremely unlikely flood event which could cause flooding of the gated spillway operating gallery due to failure of the sluice gate equalization lines, rendering the sluice gates inoperable. This extremely unlikely flood event could also cause water to flow through the dam's foundation and eventually weaken the dam. In the remote event of a dam breach, the largest impacts would be to the City of Waco, TX, located approximately 35 river miles downstream of the dam. In any of these unlikely scenarios, downstream flooding in Waco, TX would occur within 2.5 hours of breach and could be as deep as a three-story structure, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure such as fire stations, schools, and universities. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. Although the large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans, and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "In order to lower the risks associated with the dam, inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam. Surveillance and inspections would be increased as the lake elevation rises. Normal operation and maintenance is performed regularly to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. Repairs to the embankment on the upstream side of the dam were completed in 2019, and a new layer of rock was added on the upstream slope to protect the dam from wave action during periods of high water. An Emergency Action Plan is updated and exercised annually to improve emergency response and coordination between USACE elements and downstream federal, state, county, city agencies, and stakeholders. USACE also communicates risks associated with Whitney Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Barren River Dam in 1964. The Barren River Dam is located on the Barren River, 79.2 miles above its confluence with the Green River. Barren River Dam is located in south-central Kentucky, approximately 95 air miles south of Louisville, Kentucky, and 13 miles southwest of Glasgow, Kentucky. The primary purposes of the project are flood risk management, water supply, and recreation. The project reduces flood damages along approximately 79 miles of the Barren River, approximately 149 miles of the Green River and to a lesser extent on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The project has a drainage area of approximately 940 square miles. At spillway crest, the reservoir covers 20,150 acres upstream of the Barren River Dam. The project consists of a 3,970-foot long earth-filled dam embankment with a maximum height of 146 feet, a gate controlled outlet works along the base of the left abutment of the dam, and a 300-foot wide, uncontrolled, open cut spillway through the right abutment. The record pool of 582.6 feet NAVD88 occurred in March of 1989 which resulted in high releases from the dam\u2019s outlet but no discharge from the spillway (Spillway Elev. 589.6 ft NAVD88).",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in February 2017 and classified the risk associated with Barren River Dam as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4 which is considered Low relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not eliminate the risk completely. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to result in unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway.  There is also a very unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is erosion of the dam's earthen embankment during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach of the dam. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along the Barren and Green Rivers. \n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream areas. The largest impacts would be to the community of Bowling Green along the Barren River. Smaller communities in portions of Warren and Butler counties along the Barren and Green would also be impacted.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast, and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 13 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in December 1938 for the purpose of navigation. Lock and Dam 13 is located on the Mississippi River near Fulton, Illinois. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary miter gate bay, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section, a submersible earth dike spillway, and non-submersible earth dike sections. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 11 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 14,076 feet, and includes 1,066 feet of movable gate section, 11,180 feet of non-submersible earthen dike, and 1,830 feet of submersible earthen dike. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in March 2015 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 13 as low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from a large flood event overtopping the non-submersible earthen dike causing a dam failure, failures of various lock walls, and a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 13. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The Santa Rosa Dam project is owned and operated by the Albuquerque District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The project includes a dam located on the Pecos River in Guadalupe County, New Mexico, approximately seven river miles upstream of the city of Santa Rosa.  Construction was completed in 1979 and primary project features include a zoned earthen embankment dam; gated outlet works to adjust operational water releases into Pecos River; and a rock-cut spillway to pass much larger, uncontrolled flow during extreme events.  During flood events, the Santa Rosa Dam project can be operated for flood risk reduction on its own or in conjunction with other dams to optimize upstream and downstream flood risk reduction along the Pecos River.  In addition to the project\u2019s main purpose of flood risk reduction, it is authorized for sediment retention, irrigation, and recreation benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although the Santa Rosa Dam project has successfully reduced flooding, it does not eliminate all flood risk caused by rain downstream of the dam or due to emergency operation of the project.  During infrequent emergency operation, larger required releases through the project\u2019s gated outlet works would surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Pecos River.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled flow through the spillway have never occurred, uncontrolled spillway flow could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Pecos River, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Pecos River to Fort Sumner Lake, impacting the city of Santa Rosa and surrounding communities.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment of the Santa Rosa Dam project in 2015.  Results characterize dam breach risk as NORMAL due to the combination of tolerable level of life-risk and very low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the consequence of an extreme event.  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation would be life-threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Pecos River to Fort Sumner Lake, impacting the city of Santa Rosa and surrounding communities.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquakes or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included gate rehabilitation, repair and replacement of aging electrical and mechanical components, and routine vegetation removal.  Future risk communication activities include revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and development of a formal risk communication plan.  Flood warnings to notify affected communities downstream of the project are coordinated with external entities.",

Located in Bossier Parish, Louisiana\u2014approximately 18 miles northeast of Bossier City\u2014the dam helps control flooding along Bayou Bodcau and the Red River Basin. Bayou Bodcau Dam is a dry detention dam, which means that under normal conditions, there is little to no water impounded behind it. Water is temporarily stored during significant rainfall events and slowly released to reduce downstream flood risk.\n\nThe earthen dam is approximately 8,850 feet long with a maximum height of 76 feet and includes a 3,000-foot-long auxiliary dike, outlet works with twin conduits, and an uncontrolled spillway designed to pass large floods safely. The spillway is over 4,000 feet wide and can discharge more than 180,000 cubic feet per second when activated, which would fill up an Olympic sized swimming pool in 0.6 seconds.  Although the dam does not have a year-round conservation pool or designated recreation area, it plays a critical role in reducing flood risk for downstream communities, including Bossier City, Red Chute, and areas adjacent to Bayou Bodcau.\n\nBayou Bodcau Dam\u2019s outlet works consist of two open conduits and a stilling basin that reduces the energy of water released during flood operations. The dam was built without modern filter protections such as chimney or blanket drains, and seepage control is provided only by a cutoff trench installed in the valley portion of the embankment. Although it has a history of numerous, yet minor, embankment slides and seepage concerns, the dam has continued to perform as designed since construction.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Bayou Bodcau Dam greatly reduces flood risks downstream, it does not eliminate these risks. Flooding can still occur even if Bayou Bodcau Dam operates as designed. Unlikely but possible storm scenarios exist that could cause more rainfall than Bayou Bodcau Dam can safely store. To pass such a large amount of water, the dam\u2019s auxiliary spillway may activate to pass extreme flow events to keep Bayou Bodcau Dam from overtopping and breaking. If the auxiliary spillway were to activate due to a major storm, the Red Chute Levee would overtop and as much as two to six feet of water could potentially flood as far west as Bossier City. While weather can be unpredictable, spillway events can often be forecasted one-to-two days before flooding begins to impact communities. USACE is in routine communication with the National Weather Service (NWS) and the State of Louisiana Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) to ensure the proper precautions are taken.\n\nIn 2021, Bayou Bodcau Dam was assessed for any concerns that might cause the dam to fail during rare events. USACE has classified the risks of failure associated with Bayou Bodcau Dam as very low. The dam is well-built and has performed as designed since its construction in 1949. No historical storm events to date have initiated the use of the auxiliary spillway; however, in the unlikely event that a large storm event did initiate the spillway, Bayou Bodcau could rise and cause downstream flooding.  Increased reservoir levels could also increase the potential for water to seep through and erode the earthen embankment at its southern abutment where the dam meets the existing natural high ground. \n\nIf Bayou Bodcau Dam breached or failed, flood waters would be deep and swift enough to damage and destroy houses, buildings, roads, bridges, and power and water supplies and even cause loss of life. The impacts of the dam\u2019s failure would be extensive throughout Bossier City, LA and as far downstream as Coushatta, LA. If the dam were to fail, as much as 6 to 15 feet of water would flood Bossier City. Interstates I-20 and I-220 would potentially be flooded and inaccessible within the city limits. U.S. Hwy 71 would also be under water extending as far south as the southern boundary of Bossier Parish. Flooding depths of 2 to 6 feet could potentially extend as far south as Loggy Bayou. The communities of Red Chute, Bossier City, Ferguson, Blenheim, Curtis, and Coushatta, LA would be impacted by flooding if Bayou Bodcau Dam were to fail.   The flooded area would be much greater in size than what was impacted by the 2016 spring flood in northern Louisiana. In the unlikely event that Bayou Bodcau Dam breaches, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.  To prepare your family against possible flooding, please visit the National Inventory of Dams (NID) website to see maps showing the potential extent of flooding locations if Bayou Bodcau Dam were to breach.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure Bayou Bodcau Dam continues to minimize flood risks while balancing all its project functions, USACE uses the latest rainfall forecasts and stream gauge information. USACE also regularly inspects the dam and routinely reassesses its risks.\n\nTo address risks identified in a recent assessment, USACE has performed a seepage study at the dam and has armored parts of the dam with heavy stone to prevent erosion during spillway activation.\n\nUSACE coordinates closely with the National Weather Service (NWS), the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the State of Louisiana Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam. USACE continues to work with these agencies to prepare and practice for emergency response efforts related to Bayou Bodcau Dam. Close coordination with local and state emergency management officials allows agency personnel to act in a timely manner during an emergency.\n\nDuring high-water events, USACE dam safety professionals increase surveillance of the dam to 24 hours a day and are prepared to act if an issue occurs. USACE personnel also monitor river conditions to help optimize the dam\u2019s operations.",

    "projectDescription": "North Springfield Dam was constructed and is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The Dam\u2019s primary function is storing flood waters and seasonal runoff in a reservoir to reduce potentially damaging flood waters downstream of the dam along the Black River and Connecticut River. It is located 8.5 miles upstream of the point where the Black River joins the Connecticut Rivers. The reservoir (also known as the North Springfield lake) is capable of storing 1,200 acres of water which extends 5.4 miles upstream into Weathersfield, VT.  Since it began operations, the North Springfield Dam project has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $745 million .\n\nThe project consists of an earthfill dam covered in stone protection. The dam is approximately half of a mile long (2,940 feet) and 10 stories tall (120 feet). The dam has a 12-foot 9-inch diameter concrete conduit that passes under the dam and allows day-to-day river flows from the reservoir to the downstream. The conduit opening is controlled by three hydraulically controlled gates which are operated by USACE operations staff via a raised gatehouse. While the dam is capable of reducing floodwaters during most storms, during extreme weather events there is the potential for the reservoir to fill and reach its capacity. Once the reservoir is full, a large amount of water will begin to discharge over a concrete spillway weir. The spillway is a concrete armored section of the dam whose size is larger than the width of a football field (384 feet long) and located approximately two stories (24.5 feet) below the top of the dam. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing.\n\nThe project site also includes an additional, smaller dam (North Branch Dam) located approximately 3 miles upstream of North Springfield Dam on the North Branch of the Black River in Weathersfield, Vermont.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE finalized a detailed study of the North Springfield Dam in 2020 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Moderate.  The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from North Springfield Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such high releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist. \n\nThere is also an extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would result in failure of the dam and downstream flooding: water seeping through the dam\u2019s foundation soil resulting in voids forming as the soil erodes, weakening the dam.  If this event occurs, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Communities along the Black River, including North Springfield and Springfield, VT, are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Towns and cities further downstream, including Bellows Falls, VT, Brattleboro, VT, Northampton, MA, Springfield, MA, and Hartford, CT would also be impacted, but less so.\n\nEven though very unlikely, if the scenarios described above were to occur, downstream flooding could be swift and deep resulting in loss of life and destruction of buildings and infrastructure.  In the less likely dam breach scenario, flooding would happen quickly and residents will have an extremely short timeframe to evacuate before water arrives.  The water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharge.  In a worst case scenario, you could see water higher than a three story building.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists at North Springfield Dam. Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we are taking actions to further reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of North Springfield Dam and will modify operations if we feel there is risk to the public. We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner. USACE has undertaken additional study to further understand the risk associated with North Springfield Dam, and what, if any, actions can be completed to reduce the risk.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "UBreach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be very low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no estimated potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. Mark Twain Lake consist of three project features the main dam named Clarence Cannon Dam, the saddle dam, and the Re-regulation Dam. Clarence Cannon Dam is a high hazard dam located in the Upper Mississippi River Basin at mile 63.0 on the Salt River. It lies in eastern Monroe County and western Ralls County, 20 miles southwest of Hannibal, Missouri and 100 miles northwest of St. Louis, Missouri and consist of a concrete spillway section with a hydro-electric power plant and an earthen embankment section. The Saddle Dam, which consist of earthen embankment, raises a low section in the reservoir\u2019s rim to the same height as the main dam is also considered a high hazard dam. The Re-regulation dam which is considered a run-of-the-river structure, which consist of concrete spillway and earthen embankments, is a significant hazard dam located nine miles downstream. The project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 23 October 1962 and the name was changed in Section 221 of the Flood Control Act of 27 October 1965 from Joanna Reservoir to Clarence Cannon Dam and Mark Twain Lake. The project\u2019s authorized purposes include: power generation, flood control, recreation, water supply, water quality enhancement, fish and wildlife conservation, and incidental navigation. Construction occurred from 1970 to 1983 and initial filling of the pool began in August of 1983 and minimum pool elevation was achieved in January 1984.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Clarence Cannon Dam, the Saddle Dam, and the Re-regulation dam in 2018. Clarence Cannon Dam is currently categorized as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4 which is considered low urgency in that there is low incremental risk. The Saddle Dam and the Re-regulation Dam are currently categorized as a DSAC 5 which is considered low risk and is the overall lowest risk rating. Although the projects have historically performed well and the evaluated the risk as relatively low, not all risk is eliminated. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In the extreme conditions, such as extreme rainfall and earthquakes, the project may experience conditions that it was not designed for, and increased inspections and performance monitoring will occur. Failure is defined as the sudden and uncontrolled release of water.  The three probable failures all require an exceptionally rare rainfall events in the first which the Main Dam is overtopping that for a duration that leads to breach and in the other two the pool is at the top of the dam. For the other two failures, pool is loaded up to the crest for an extended duration that through seepage progresses to breach or a concrete monolith slides allowing the pool to breach. The Saddle Dam primary and only failure was due to overtopping and erosion that allows breach of the embankment. The Re-regulation Dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, Clarence Cannon Dam has an emergency action plan to reduce the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios were to occur.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam which include inundation maps that have been released to the public via NID. \nIn addition to emergency preparedness routine instrumentation, inspections, and risk assessments are conducted and increased surveillance occurs when hazards exceed pre-established thresholds to ensure the structures are performing as designed. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Subject matter experts are monitoring the weather, expected precipitation, regional conditions, and pool conditions to anticipate impacts, make projections, and advise on deviations in order to further reduce the risk of an extreme loading event.",

    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Blue Mountain Dam in June 2021 that characterizes the risks associated with the project as low based on good performance and the design of the dam.\nThe dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities, but it does not eliminate it. The initial Screening Portfolio Risk Assessment (SPRA), conducted in 2008, identified overtopping, spillway chute failure, and seepage and piping of the embankment as potential failure modes. It was recommended the dam be categorized as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4. \nThe 2021 risk assessment confirmed that overtopping remains the primary risk driver of the project, but only under extreme flood conditions \u2013 those exceeding the calculated Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) and at an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) of less than 1E-06. \nThe 2008 SPRA also identified internal erosion within the embankment as a risk driver. However, ongoing monitoring and a filter compatible chimney drain intersecting the construction interface is functioning as intended. Similarly, the chute walls are considered stable and unlikely to fail due to the tie-in of the walls to high ground. No other failure modes were identified as posing a risk to the project. The dam maintains a DSAC 4 rating.",

Participants included Little Rock District Emergency Management and Infrastructure Safety staff, and state and local emergency management officials. Since the project is currently categorized as DSAC 4, an Interim Risk-Reduction Measures Plan (IRRMP) is not required. Routine dam safety activities and normal operations, maintenance, monitoring, and evaluation are considered appropriate.",

    "projectDescription": "Kanopolis Dam is a High Hazard Potential dam located on the Smoky Hill River, approximately 181 river miles upstream of the confluence with the Republican River at Junction City, Kansas. It is 19 miles west and 16 miles south of Salina, Kansas.  The authorized project purposes include flood control, silt control, irrigation, water supply, low flow supplementation, recreation, and fish and wildlife.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment, gated outlet works with an uncontrolled overflow notch, and an uncontrolled spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Risk of a breach of Kanopolis Dam is understood to be above levels tolerable by society.  Kanopolis Dam\u2019s greatest life safety risk is due to potential overtopping breach of the earthen dam in an extremely large flood event.  Other potential failure modes include erosion due to leakage through the dam and failure of the downstream seepage collection system which could lead to erosion of the dam\u2019s foundation.  Life loss consequences would be very high (100 to 1,000 fatalities) for a dam breach during an extreme flood event with affected areas extending along the Smoky Hill River past Salina, KS and along the Kansas River to Kansas City and beyond.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is currently pursuing a more detailed risk assessment to further evaluate the risk of dam breach.  While further study is being pursued to better understand the risk, routine monitoring and surveillance, instrumentation readings evaluate the performance of the structure.  USACE periodically hosts tabletop exercises with local emergency management agencies to improve understanding of risks and improve response in case of a dam emergency.  Stockpiles of emergency supplies are kept on site.  Additionally, USACE will update documents detailing the required monitoring of the dam and actions planned in case of emergency.  Additional risk communication efforts will be pursued.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Stonewall Jackson Dam in 1988 across the West Fork River to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the West Fork, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers, including metropolitan Pittsburgh.  The dam is located about one mile upstream of Weston, West Virginia and forms the Stonewall Jackson Reservoir.  The reservoir stores rainfall to maintain downstream flow within the downstream river banks and releases water after flood events. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $440 million. The reservoir also serves to store rainfall from late winter through early summer to augment downstream river flow during the drier late summer and early autumn months.  The reservoir also provides recreational opportunities to the region, including at the Stonewall Resort State Park, which is situated along the reservoir. Stonewall Jackson Dam is composed of concrete and has a maximum height of 95 feet and has a length of 620 feet.  The central portion of the dam contains openings, which form a spillway.  The spillway is designed to release a large volume of water to the downstream river during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Stonewall Jackson Dam was completed in 2022, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as very low. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Stonewall Jackson Dam would be an uncontrolled high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during unusually intense storm events. The frequency and amount of water released could cause flooding in downstream communities. Such water releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.  There is also one less likely, but far more devastating scenario that could produce significant flooding during an extreme rainfall event:  if the reservoir level rises above the crest of the dam, the overflowing water could erode the soil downstream of the dam, potentially causing a dam breach by allowing one or more of the concrete dam segments to move downstream.  If this were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Weston and other communities located in the valley below the dam are in more immediate danger in the event of a flood. Towns and cities further downstream including Clarksburg and Morgantown, have larger populations and less awareness of the dam, but will also have greater warning times, should a flood occur.  In either of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, we will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plan. We will continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events.  Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high-water event is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses.  We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current lake levels at the Stonewall Jackson Lake is available to the public via the internet at: \n\nhttps://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/03057900/#dataTypeId=continuous-62615-0&period=P7D&showMedian=true",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Pomona Dam, completing in 1963. Pomona Dam is located on 110 Mile Creek, a tributary of the Marais des Cygnes River, approximately 8.5 miles west and 3 miles north of the town of Pomona Kansas. 23 miles downstream of the dam is the community of Ottawa, KS. The dam was authorized for flood control, water supply, water quality, recreation, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Pomona Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $707 million (2021 price level) from 1962 to 2020. The dam is 7,750 feet long composed of rolled impervious, pervious seepage collection, and berm zones. The top of the dam sits approximately 111 feet above the streambed.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed Pomona\u2019s storage capacity can cause the release of water down the uncontrolled spillway, even if the river is at or beyond capacity to prevent overtopping and failure of dam. This can result in flooding at downstream communities or can worsen already existing flooding if the rivers are over capacity. \n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment for Pomona Dam in March 2022 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low. In an extreme flood scenario, inflows into the lake may exceed the storage and release capacity of the dam, and overtopping may occur. If overtopping occurs the earthen embankment of dam could erode leading to a sudden release of water downstream. This would result in extreme flooding downstream including affecting the community of Ottawa, KS.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Inundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.  More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "Grayson Dam was designed and built by the Huntington District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The project was completed in 1968 under the Flood Control Act of 14 July 1960, Public Law 86-645 and is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntington District. Grayson Dam and Lake is located on the Little Sandy River approximately 13 miles upstream of Grayson, Kentucky and approximately 52 river miles upstream of the Little Sandy\u2019s confluence with the Ohio River at Greenup, Kentucky. The primary purpose of Grayson Dam is to reduce flood risks to the residents and businesses downstream. The dam also provides for water supply, water quality control, recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement. \n\nThe earthen dam has a length of 1,460 feet and a height of 120 feet above the streambed. There is a 200 feet wide, unregulated emergency spillway located to the left of the dam (looking downstream) that would go into operation during extreme flood events to prevent the dam from overtopping.  The dam\u2019s primary outlet works tunnel has a maximum discharge capacity of 11,900 cubic feet per second (cfs) and the emergency spillway has a maximum discharge capacity of 95,000 cfs.  \n\nThis dam has prevented a total of $451 million dollars of flood damages between its construction and 2021. This means that the dam prevents about $8 million of flood damages every year. Grayson Lake also provides 1.5 million gallons of water per day to the residents of Carter, Elliott, and Lawrence Counties.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although Grayson Dam has historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event. This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillway.  In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam's construction.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Grayson Dam in 2023 and classified the risk associated with failure as low. This risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the open spillway to the south of the dam has the potential to pass over 90,000 cubic feet of water per second. The dam\u2019s spillway would pass these storms to keep the dam from overtopping. \n\nThe Grayson Dam spillway has never been operated, but if it were operated it could result in significant flooding in Grayson and Greenup along I-64. Additionally, backwater flooding could impact Denton upstream. Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur. Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along the Little Sandy River may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows. Although the odds of such a storm event occurring are considered extremely unlikely, Grayson Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any unanticipated scenarios were to occur.\n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach hillside to hillside quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location. In the unlikely event Grayson Dam must pass these extreme waters, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Grayson Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions. Flood fighting materials are stored onsite in case of an emergency.",

Big Cliff Dam is a 182 ft tall, 295 ft long concrete gravity dam with a concrete spillway, three spillway gates, a non-overflow section, and a powerhouse. Big Cliff dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1951 and was completed in 1954. Big Cliff Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project.\n\nBig Cliff Dam is 2.8 miles downstream of Detroit Dam. Big Cliff is a re-regulating dam for Detroit and is operated to provide consistent flows into the river downstream while allowing for fluctuations in outflow from Detroit Dam. The re-regulation of flow allows for Detroit Dam's powerhouse to meet peak electricity demands on a daily basis for the region.\n\nBig Cliff Dam is located about 95 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. USACE completed a routine risk assessment for the Big Cliff Dam in April 2021 that characterizes the risk associated with the dam to be Low.\n\nThe assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. The risk is driven by two factors including: downstream population combined with the potential for an extreme earthquake occurring during routine dam operations. According to the study, an extreme earthquake could damage the spillway gates or spillway gate piers resulting in an uncontrolled release through the spillway causing flooding downstream. Because Big Cliff Dam is located upstream of several rural communities along the North Santiam River there is potential for flooding to affect downstream communities in the floodplain and along the narrow canyons.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Big Cliff Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Big Cliff Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue to increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of W. D. Mayo Lock and Dam No. 14 in 1970 for the purposes of navigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife.  W. D. Mayo is located on the Arkansas River about 9 miles southwest of Fort Smith, Arkansas.  The project consists of an embankment dam, concrete gated spillway, and lock chamber that allows barge and other boat traffic to travel up and down the river.  The lock is used to transport various agricultural, industrial, and other goods up and down the river in a cost-effective manner.   Under normal river conditions, the flows within the river are controlled by spillway gates to ensure river levels are high enough for navigation barge traffic.  During flooding, the spillway gates are fully open and the river runs under the gates similar to how the river would flow if the project was not in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of W.D. Mayo lock and Dam in 2015 and classified the risk as low.  The two primary risks to the lock and dam  are (1) the potential for failure of the structure that closes the lock for maintenance dewatering  and (2) the potential for failure of a lock gate.  In the remote event of a lock or dam failure, navigation traffic would be halted and economic impacts would occur. A large increase in downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail as the dam is not designed or operated to reduce downstream flooding, but instead for navigation purposes. However, widespread flooding could occur downstream along the river as part of normal operation of the dam (when the gates are fully opened during a large flood).",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that a failure of W. D. Mayo Lock and Dam would pose to river navigation.  The primary action being taken is design and construction of a new system to allow maintenance dewatering and repairs to occur.  There are numerous additional activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well-maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the to ensure the integrity of the structure.  USACE also has maintains close coordination and communication with the navigation industry. Lastly, instrumentation and monitoring systems are in place to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for RC Byrd Locks and Dam in 2021 and classified the risk associated with failure as low. \n\nInundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Brandon Road Lock and Dam was started by the State of Illinois in 1927 but was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1933 for the purpose of navigation. Brandon Road Lock and Dam is located on the Des Plaines River near Rockdale, Illinois. The project consists of a lock chamber, a dam, and channel walls. The lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 34 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 2,602 feet and consists of an embankment section 92 feet long, the abandoned Illinois and Michigan Canal lock, an embankment section with concrete core wall 490 feet long, the main lock, an embankment section with concrete core wall 330 feet long, a headgate section 320 feet long with 8 operable headgates and 8 headgates permanently sealed with concrete, an 18 feet wide concrete pier, an abandoned sluice gate section 91 feet in length originally containing 6 sluice gates, and the Tainter gate section 1,231 feet long with 21 Tainter gates. Mass concrete channel wall extends upstream from the dam 2.17 miles on the north bank and 2.33 miles on the south bank.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in November 2020 and classified the risk associated with Brandon Road Lock and Dam as low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from a failure of the south channel wall due to a barge impact, and a failure of the upper miter gate anchorage resulting in a shutdown of the lock. Although unlikely, a failure at the dam would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. A failure of the south channel wall would inundate residential areas adjacent to and east of the wall and south to the outlet of the dam by more than 6 feet of water. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure at the dam, but there is estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the south channel wall.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Brandon Road Lock and Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans. USACE is developing a detailed communication plan based on the latest risk assessment findings and will engage in communication activities with state and local representatives, stakeholders, emergency managers, and the public to increase awareness.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Hildebrand Lock and Dam in 1959 across the Allegheny River.  The dam is located about 7 miles downstream of the Opekiska Lock and Dam and about 108 miles upstream of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, PA. The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam to Opekiska Lock and Dam. The dam consists of a two concrete spillway sections and six steel gates through which the river flows.  The lock provides a lift of about 21 feet, which is the height of the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool upstream of the dam (upper pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 84 feet wide by 600 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The pool created by the dam also provides recreation opportunities for surrounding communities. The economic benefits of the dam are about 200 thousand dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2021, which characterized the risk as very low, because there is no potential for life loss or significant economic damages in the unlikely event that the dam fails. If the upper pool of the dam is released due to a dam failure, the consequences would be the loss of river traffic and recreation which would damage the regional economy by about 200 thousand dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored. Although this scenario is possible, the dam has performed well for over 80 years without incident.  Due to the relatively short height of the dam, which lies entirely within the banks of the Allegheny River, downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communication and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam or that may adversely affect economic benefits.  We regularly update our emergency action plan. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the Shenango Dam across the Shenango River in 1965 to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in the low-lying communities in the Shenango and Beaver River valleys, including Sharpsville, Sharon, and New Castle, Pennsylvania.  The dam forms the Shenango River Lake and is located about 34 miles upstream of the confluence of the Shenango River and the Mahoning River which form the Beaver River, a tributary to the Ohio River.  Shenango Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $250 million since the start of operations. The reservoir stores rainfall to maintain downstream flow within the downstream riverbanks, releases water after flood events and provides numerous opportunities for recreation.  Shenango Dam is a concrete dam and has a maximum height of about 68 feet and a length of about 720 feet.  The dam has a 300-foot-long spillway, designed to release a large volume of water during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.  Immediately downstream of the dam, the riverbed is lined with concrete slabs (stilling basin) that are intended to prevent erosion of the riverbed when water is flowing over the dam\u2019s spillway.  The reservoir also serves to store rainfall and melted snow during the spring months and releases water to the river in the drier autumn months.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Shenango Dam was completed in 2022, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as very low.  The dam was well-constructed and is well-maintained.  However, significant populations live downstream of Shenango Dam, including those in Sharpsville, Sharon, and New Castle and other low-lying communities on the Shenango and Beaver Rivers.  Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding to these communities, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from Shenango Dam would be a high-volume release over the dam\u2019s spillway (which has never experienced flow since the project was put into full operation in 1965) during an unusually large and intense storm event.  Water released over the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam had not been constructed.  \n\nThere are three less likely, but far more devastating scenarios that would produce significant flooding during an already extreme rainfall event: 1) Water flowing over the spillway could lift sections of the concrete stilling basin floor, leading to erosion of the riverbed that results in downstream movement of a portion of the concrete dam; 2) Horizontal leakage through the concrete dam results in a portion of the concrete dam sliding downstream; 3) The reservoir rises above the top of the dam; water flowing over them dam erodes the ground downstream of the dam, resulting in a portion of the concrete dam moving downstream. Each of these scenarios would result in breach of the dam with some or all or some of the water in the reservoir swiftly flowing into the downstream Shenango River.  Although these scenarios are very unlikely, they are possible.\n\nIn any of these scenarios, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Communities, including Sharpsville and Sharon, that are closer to the dam, are in more immediate danger of a significant flood event and may have little advanced warning.  Cities and communities further downstream of the dam, such as New Castle, possibly have less awareness of the dam but will have more warning. \n\nWith any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, possibly overflowing banks on the Shenango and Beaver Rivers, and destroying buildings and infrastructure.  Anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently during high-water events.  Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high-water event is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses.  We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current lake levels at the Shenango River Lake is available to the public via the internet at: \n\nhttps://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/03103400/#dataTypeId=continuous-00045-0&period=P7D&showMedian=true",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Gray\u2019s Landing Lock and Dam across the Monongahela River in 1995.  The dam is located in Fayette and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, near Masontown, about 82 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at Pittsburgh.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Point Marion Lock and Dam, which is located near Point Marion, Pennsylvania. The dam is concrete and has a fixed crest.  The lock provides a lift of 15 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock includes of a rectangular lock chamber that is 84 feet wide by 720 feet long.  The lock chambers is formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  A concrete wall supports the left bank of the river near the dam.  The pool created by the dam also provides water supply to municipal and industrial intakes and recreational opportunities to the region.  The total economic benefit of shipping materials and goods through the lock is more than $21 million dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2009, which characterized the risk as low. The assessment identified one scenario that could cause the dam to fail: during a period of unusually high river levels, the river could erode the soil on the left bank, which could potentially result in a loss of the upper pool.  If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequence would be the loss of shipping and water supply, which would damage the regional economy by more than $21 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping and water supply.  Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure all steps are being taken to reduce the risk to the economy, USACE will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and the changes to the lock operations. We regularly update the emergency action plan and conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  Rainfall forecasts are closely followed to determine when high river events may occur, in order to provide industry information or notifications necessary for the public. River levels are closely monitored, and advisories are issued if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "Willow Creek Dam is located in the town of Heppner, Ore. about 50 miles southwest of Pendleton. The dam is situated on Willow Creek which is a tributary to the Columbia River. Willow Creek Dam was constructed in 1983 and is the first dam constructed entirely using roller-compacted concrete (RCC). The total length of the dam is 1,780-feet with a maximum height of 157-feet. The dam includes two non-overflow sections, an ungated spillway section with a concrete stilling basin, and an outlet works. The authorized purposes at this project are flood risk management, irrigation, recreation, sports fishing and wildlife.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Willow Creek Dam in 2017 that characterized the life-safety risks associated with the project as low. The assessment determined that a large earthquake could cause instability along concrete joints in the RCC dam and release water through the dam, flooding downstream communities. The assessment also determined that the high flows from a large and unlikely flood could damage and erode the ungated spillway, but the short duration of flooding would limit potential impacts to downstream communities. The team concluded that the likelihood of earthquake damage to the RCC dam is very low since the dam is in an area of low earthquake hazard.   \n\nUSACE is confident that the Willow Creek Dam is well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the flood risk management dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and will continue to evaluate the condition and risks associated with Willow Creek Dam through routine studies. Willow Creek is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance, including new sensors installed in 2018 to monitor the conditions along the RCC joints. USACE is updating its Emergency Action Plan based on the results of the risk assessment to improve risk communication and increase public awareness. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages. USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nAlthough Barre Falls Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Barre Falls Dam is designed to manage peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Barre Falls Dam through the ungated spillway during high water events. This type of water release occurs when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Water moving through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a four-story building. While weather can be unpredictable, this type of event can often be predicted 1-2 days before flood waters would impact downstream communities. USACE will engage state emergency managers when such an event is forecasted and support actions to get people to safety.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment in 2015, and a 2025 risk assessment is currently underway. The 2015 assessment  classified the risks associated with the Barre Falls Dam as low. The breach of Barre Falls Dam at Max High Pool would cause a flood that would inundate areas in cities along the Ware River and Chicopee River.  The primary life safety risk exists on the Ware River, particularly in Ware, MA and Barre/South Barre, MA.  Two unlikely, but devastating scenarios that would produce significant downstream flooding are breach of the dam due to water flowing over the top of Dike 3 or embankment erosion leading to breach. In the case of an extremely rare and large rain event, water could potentially flow over the top of the dike, which could cause erosion of the earthen embankment, and breach of the dike. In addition, internal erosion of the embankment could create a flow path through the dam, which would eventually allow the crest to collapse.  In these scenarios, downstream flooding in South Barre would occur about four hours after breach and the rapidly moving water could destroy buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nBarre Falls Dam is staffed full time.  During high pools, Barre Falls Dam is inspected on a daily basis.   When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no estimated potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Long Branch Dam, completing in 1978. Long Branch Dam is located at River Mile 78 on the East Fork Little Chariton River, in Macon County, Missouri. The dam was authorized for flood control, water supply, water quality control, recreation, and fish & wildlife enhancement. Long Branch Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $82.9 million (2018 price level) from 1978 to 2017.  Water supply benefits are estimated at $6.3 million annually. The dam is a rolled earthfill embankment approximately 3,800 feet long, the top of which is a maximum of 71 feet above the valley floor. Downstream of the dam the population is very sparse; the majority of the affected area due to flooding is agricultural land.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Long Branch Dam in January 2019 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the project\u2019s risk is characterized as low. USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate flooding. Extreme rainfall events could cause the reservoir to overflow through the spillway. The spillway discharges to the East Fork Little Chariton River and spillway flows may cause flooding of the agricultural land downstream. Erosion of the unlined spillway may occur during spillway flows.\n\nIf an extreme flooding event that leads to inflows into the reservoir greater than the reservoir capacity, overtopping may occur. If overtopping occurs the earthen embankment portion of dam could erode leading to a sudden release of water downstream. This would result in the immediate release of water, and extreme flooding downstream of the dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high reservoir levels. Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high reservoir level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities and farmers downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "Hills Creek Dam is located on the Middle Fork of the Willamette River three miles upstream of Oakridge and 42 miles upstream of Eugene/Springfield, Oregon. Hills Creek Dam is a 304 ft tall, 1,920 ft long rockfill earthen embankment dam with a concrete spillway, three spillway gates, an intake structure with regulating outlet, and a powerhouse. Hills Creek dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1956 and was completed in 1961. Hills Creek is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project.\n\nDuring the winter months, the reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snowmelt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, produce hydropower, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season. Hills Creek is upstream of Lookout Point Dam and Dexter Dam.\n\nHills Creek Dam is located about 90 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone can produce very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. The assessments consider a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. USACE has been conducting advanced risk assessments, called Issue Evaluation Studies (IES), at several Willamette Valley Project dams including Hills Creek Dam. As of April 2019, results of the IES for Hills Creek Dam identified the risk associated with the dam to be High. The risk is driven by two factors: the high population downstream combined with the potential for an extreme earthquake occurring at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest. According to the IES, an extreme earthquake could cause the earthen dam to settle, resulting in water overtopping the dam. It is difficult to predict the exact amount of settlement that could occur to the dam as a result of such an earthquake. The speed and depth of water overtopping a damaged dam could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam and cause significant flooding downstream. Because Hills Creek Dam is located upstream of Oakridge, Lowell, Jasper, Eugene, and Springfield Oregon, there is potential for devastating flooding to affect large downstream populations in urban areas and surrounding suburbs, as well as rural communities in the floodplain and narrow canyons.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The likelihood is very low for an extreme earthquake to occur, but the potential impacts of a dam failure are very high due to the large downstream population. Therefore, immediate action is warranted to reduce risk to acceptable levels. Targeted measures (called Interim Risk Reduction Measures) were implemented in spring 2020 to reduce life-safety risk while issues identified in the Study are evaluated further. These measures include reducing the maximum conservation pool (the highest allowable level during summer) of Hills Creek reservoir by 10 feet. USACE continues to evaluate the seismic performance of the embankment to determine if long-term modifications will be necessary. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Hills Creek Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Hills Creek Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Leech as a timber dam and began operations in 1885; and reconstructed it as a more permanent concrete structure in 1903.  Leech (located in Federal Dam, Minnesota) is one of six headwaters\u2019 dams on the Mississippi River.  The headwaters dams were constructed to supplement river flows for navigation purposes by filling the lakes in the spring and drafting them down as needed during the summer; but the headwaters dams have rarely been used for that purpose since the water control plans were revised in 1945.  The downstream lock & dam system constructed in the 1930\u2019s nearly eliminated the need for upstream water storage, so the dam is primarily operated to optimize recreation and environmental benefits. The control structure has 21 bays (6 feet wide) controlled by stoplogs, 1 log sluice bay (12 feet wide) with stoplogs, and 5 bays fitted with slide gates.  The control structure is founded on timber piles.  An earth embankment extends about 3300 feet north of the control structure.  The dam has been extensively modified numerous times in its history, including removal of 13 spillway bays due to complications during a 1957 rehabilitation contract.  The dam served as a highway bridge until the late 1960\u2019s when the County State Aid Highway No. 8 bridge was constructed just downstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE currently has Leech listed as a moderate-risk dam (DSAC-3) among its more than 700 dams, but this is expected to be revised to low-risk (DSAC 4) following approval of a draft risk assessment conducted in 2021.  The risk ranking is based on a screening-level assessment in 2009 that cited concerns for overtopping and decaying timber stoplogs.  A risk assessment in 2021 recommends reducing the risk ranking based on a lack of plausible failure modes.  Hydrologic adequacy studies show the dam can withstand floods exceeding the plausible maximum flood that is a design standard for high hazard dams.   Even with clogging of the spillway, the large lake size can contain extreme floods.  The potential consequences of a breach in Leech are primarily economic or environmental.  Dam breach modeling shows no direct loss of life, so Leech is listed as a significant hazard dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public.  USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.   Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Funding has been requested to evaluate fish passage at Leech.  Fish passage alternatives may consider potential modifications to the dam, but such alternations do not directly stem from dam safety concerns.",

    "projectDescription": "Cherry Creek Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Operating since the early 1950s, it is the first of three \u201ctri-lakes\u201d dams built by USACE to collectively reduce risks from flooding in the Denver metropolitan area. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, USACE manages water releases from this tri-lakes system for recreation, water quality, and to support fish and wildlife.\n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment with an outlet structure for releasing stored water. Excess water during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt can flow through an earthen spillway to the north of the embankment. This would flow into the adjacent Toll Gate and Sand Creek drainage basins. During normal operations, the outlet structure provides water to downstream users and releases are generally less than 100 cubic feet of water per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons). As operations shift to reducing flood risks the outlet structure is used to manage the reservoir elevation and can release up to 10,000 cfs. When the need to release water from the reservoir exceeds the outlet structure\u2019s capacity, water flowing through the spillway would reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The estimated maximum flow through the spillway is 45,000 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release. The reservoir has never been high enough for spillway flow. \n\nThe largest release from Cherry Creek Dam as a result of flooding was approximately 560 cfs from the outlet structure in 1965. It is important to understand that the dam and spillway are designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Cherry Creek Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can the system of dams in which it operates). While unlikely, a non-breach release when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n \nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threat that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, is overtopping. Although this scenario is extremely unlikely, failure of the dam would result in catastrophic flooding with swift, deep, and life-threatening floodwater in many parts of the Denver area, and communities along the South Platte River and tributaries including Cherry, Toll Gate, and Sand creeks. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities).     \n\nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Cherry Creek Dam as \u201chigh\u201d among its more than 700 dams due\u2013should a breach occur\u2013to the consequences to the highly urbanized downstream communities where the population has significantly increased since the dam was built. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure. For more information on the USACE Dam Safety Program and risk assessments, visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Ongoing Actions:  The USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks.  For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.\n\nActions at Cherry Creek Dam: As a responsible dam owner, USACE completed a Dam Safety Modification Study in 2019 to evaluate opportunities to further reduce risks associated with Cherry Creek Dam.  While the study resulted in the decision not to structurally alter the dam itself due to the extremely low likelihood of failure, USACE removed sediment that restricted flow through the spillway to reduce the probability of overtopping. In addition, USACE completed several non-structural actions to further reduce risks. These included updating gages to better monitor the reservoir and drainage basins during extreme runoff events and improving runoff forecast models in coordination with the National Weather Service to accelerate warnings from local emergency management agencies. As an added precaution, the Water Control Manual was modified to allow the staff who operate the dam, in coordination with the State of Colorado, to accelerate the release of stored water to further reduce the risk of overtopping.  \n\nBuilding Awareness:  Since dams do not eliminate flood risk, communities downstream of Denver-area dams are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to their family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Arkport Dam in 1940 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located in the headwaters of the Canisteo River in Steuben County, NY, approximately one mile upstream of the village of Arkport and 8 miles upstream of Hornell.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment which creates a lake only during storm events.  Flow discharges through a conduit in the abutment of the dam and the project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Arkport Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to the Canisteo River.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Arkport, Hornell, Canisteo and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Canisteo River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Arkport Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Arkabutla Dam in 1943 and continues to own, operate, and maintain the facility today. Located across the Coldwater River, the dam helps control flooding along the Yazoo River Basin for more than 18,000 residents and more than 7,000 homes and businesses totaling nearly $700 Million.  The dam also provides water-based and other outdoor recreation opportunities. The 85-foot-tall, earthen-filled dam is located four miles north of Arkabutla, Mississippi, and is approximately 10,700 feet (over 2 miles) long. \nUnder normal conditions, Arkabutla Dam and Reservoir is managed throughout the year to store and slowly release water to help keep the Coldwater River within its banks and to reduce the peak flow of rainfall runoff. The lake is drawn down during the fall and winter to provide needed storage during periods of prevalent rainfall. The lake is filled during the spring and summer to provide recreational opportunities to the visiting public. This management is in accordance with the project\u2019s congressionally authorized Water Control Plan. \nReservoir water is released into the Coldwater River through a concrete tunnel in the dam controlled by 3 large gates. These gates can release enough water to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in nine seconds. The dam\u2019s overflow spillway is located on its north side and is designed to pass high volumes of flood waters to prevent the dam from being overtopped and potentially breached. On rare occasions when the spillway is activated, the water passes over a concrete rim and down a 300-foot wide concrete slope into the spillway outlet channel and eventually back into the Coldwater River. This overflow spillway can release enough water to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in one second. Arkabutla Lake has flowed over the overflow spillway thirteen times since the dam was constructed, with the most recent overflow occurring in 2019.\n*Update\t\nA 2023 declaration of emergency at Arkabutla Dam has temporarily altered the way that the reservoir is being managed. Due to the dam\u2019s critical condition, the reservoir has been drawn down to elevation 204 ft to reduce the risk of dam failure and minimize impacts to downstream populations. This water level is 6 ft lower than what is generally held during winter pool levels, and this level will be maintained throughout the whole year until permanent repairs can be installed.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Arkabutla Dam greatly reduces flood risks downstream, it does not eliminate these risks. Flooding can still occur even if Arkabutla Dam operates as designed. Unlikely but possible storm scenarios exist that could cause more rainfall than Arkabutla Dam can safely store. To pass such a large amount of water, the dam gates may need to be fully opened; and the dam\u2019s overflow spillway may activate to pass extreme flow events to keep Arkabutla Dam from overtopping and potentially breaching. If the overflow spillway were to activate due to a major storm, two-to-six feet of water could flood the Mississippi Delta as far west as Tunica and as far south as Greenwood and Indianola. This water would likely flood farm fields and low-lying areas.  As much as six-to-fifteen feet of water could be expected near the Coldwater River in Tunica County along MS Hwy 3 with two-to-six feet of water expected near the Coldwater, Tallahatchie, and Yazoo Rivers in Quitman, Tallahatchie, and Leflore Counties.  While weather can be unpredictable, overflow spillway events can often be forecasted one-to-two days before flooding begins to impact communities. USACE is in routine communication with the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) to ensure the proper precautions are taken.\nIn 2023, Arkabutla Dam was re-assessed for any concerns that might cause the dam to fail after a moderate sized sinkhole was discovered on the downstream toe of the dam, adjacent to the outlet tunnel and toe road. USACE re-classified the risks of failure associated with Arkabutla Dam from moderate to very high due to heightened concerns of foundation material loss under the outlet works, and historic seepage issues into the tunnel. If enough foundation material is lost, the toe could collapse, causing the top of the dam to fall downward, allowing the reservoir to overtop the dam. USACE is currently taking measures to reduce the risk of failure, which are summarized in the \u201cRisk Management\u201d paragraph below. \nIf Arkabutla Dam breached or failed, flood waters would be deep and swift enough to damage and destroy houses, buildings, roads, bridges, and power and water supplies and even cause loss of life. The impacts of the dam\u2019s failure would be extensive throughout the Mississippi Delta region. The flooded area would be similar in size to the area impacted by the Yazoo Backwater Flood in 2019. In the unlikely event that Arkabutla Dam breaches, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.  To prepare your family against possible flooding, please visit the National Inventory of Dams (NID) website to see maps showing the potential extent of flooding locations if Arkabutla Dam were to breach.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "In 2023, a large depression formed at the downstream toe of the dam, near the outlet tunnel and toe road. After investigation, the sinkhole was found to be caused by material loss underneath the dam through the outlet works, which is a serious concern. If the foundation material loss was allowed to continue without mitigation, the dam could fail. The Vicksburg District acted by lowering Arkabutla Lake, which in turn reduces the amount of material loss and reduces downstream impacts if the dam were to fail.  USACE also declared a Dam Safety Emergency on May 9, 2023, which heightened public awareness of the issues at the dam. The lake will continue to be held at lower pool stages until a final repair can be implemented, which could take many years. \nIn the meantime, USACE has implemented Phase I of smaller interim repairs that will reduce breach risks immediately. These repairs consist of stopping material loss by closing off a deteriorated drainage feature and replacing it with new relief wells. Multiple automated groundwater monitoring devices were installed in the embankment which allow engineers to monitor subsurface flow conditions in real time which reduces reaction time to changing conditions. Phase II interim repairs will include foundation stabilization of the outlet works and tunnel which are expected to be implemented in the summer of 2025. While these interim repairs do reduce breach risks quickly, they do not reduce risks to an acceptable level, which is why the lake will remain lowered until USACE can verify that the dam is safe to return to normal operation.\nArkabutla Dam has also had multiple instances where material has been found to be piping through the joints of the tunnel. If enough foundation material is lost through the tunnel, it could cause the tunnel to shift, creating an open void for flow and foundation material to move through. USACE has grouted the problematic joints 13 times since the dam built in 1943. USACE routinely inspects the tunnel when reservoir conditions permit which allows for fast response to degrading joint condition. \nFull repairs for both the tunnel and the outlet works will be designed through a study that has already been initiated, called a Dam Safety Modification Study. This study looks at a permanent, robust, and resilient design that will greatly reduce risks over the entirety of the project. This design could be very expensive and may take many years to fund construction. Once constructed, the dam will be put back into its normal operation and will be managed for all of its congressionally authorized benefits, including flood control and recreation. \nUSACE coordinates closely with the National Weather Service (NWS), the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam. USACE continues to work with these agencies to prepare and practice for emergency response efforts related to Arkabutla Dam. Close coordination with local and state emergency management officials allows agency personnel to act in a timely manner during an emergency.\nDuring high-water events, USACE dam safety professionals increase surveillance of the dam to 24 hours a day and are prepared to act if an issue occurs. USACE personnel also monitor river conditions to help optimize the dam\u2019s operations.",

    "projectDescription": "USACE completed construction of Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge Dam in 1958 with the project purpose to provide flood risk management, water supply, environmental regulation, and recreation. Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge Dam impounds Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge and is located on the Cypress Creek about 9 miles west of Jefferson, Texas. The project is one of 17 USACE flood control projects in a comprehensive plan for flood control on the Red River below Denison Dam, Texas. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $119,832,000 million (adjusted to 2020 dollars). Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge Dam works in conjunction with Caddo Lake (National Inventory of Dams LA00181) to regulate flows along the Cypress Creek, which feeds into the Red River. During large storm events, the dam temporarily stores flood waters to manage flooding downstream in accordance with the approved water control plan. After the storm passes and the Red River Basin recedes, water can be safety released downstream. Water storage and releases are managed by two water control gates operated by onsite USACE personnel. The project is primarily an earthen embankment dam and includes a 200-foot wide concrete spillway, which holds water to 27.5-feet below the top of the dam to regulate the reservoir when the pool elevation exceeds capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding are high volume releases from Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge Dam through the un-gated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment in June 2017 and classified the risk associated with Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge Dam as moderate. This risk classification is primarily driven by the very low probability for dam failure and the number of large populations at risk below Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge Dam. The potential of breach for Lake O\u2019 the Pines and Ferrells Bridge Dam was assessed to be related to two primary risks associated with earthen embankment dams: 1) During an extreme flood event, the foundation upon which the dam was built may experience excessive pressures beyond its design which could then lead to erosion of the embankment foundation and eventual breach of the dam, and 2) During an extreme flood event, undermining of the foundation below the concrete spillway could lead to slab displacement and uncontrolled erosion of the supporting embankment leading to breach of the am. In the remote event of a dam breach the largest impacts would be to the cities of Shreveport and Alexandria, Louisiana. Potentially impacted infrastructure includes road networks, electrical substations, communication facilities, police and fire stations, hospitals, airports, and schools. Levees in the downstream populated areas may experience overtopping and would not contain the floodwaters. Although the downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans; and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure; local emergency managers meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, breach of the dam from either risk category could result in catastrophic flooding downstream and include widespread economic impacts and significant loss of life.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is continually taking proactive steps to reduce risk and ensure public safety. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning; annual updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions; and development of a detailed communications plan for the dam. USACE will continue to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as stockpiling materials to mitigate the potential for erosion of the embankment or foundation. Additionally, the dam is well maintained and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and increased surveillance during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions and there are pre-positioned materials at the project site to perform immediate flood fighting activities as necessary.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Inundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.  More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The Galisteo Dam project is owned and operated by the Albuquerque District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The project includes a potential dam located on Galisteo Creek, 12 miles upstream from its confluence with the Rio Grande near Santo Domingo Pueblo in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, and approximately 40 miles upstream of Albuquerque.  Construction was completed in 1970 and primary project features include a zoned earthen embankment dam, ungated outlet works to pass intermittent flows of Galisteo Creek (preventing retention of a permanent pool); and rock-cut spillway to pass much larger, uncontrolled flows during extreme events.  During flood events, the Galisteo Dam project can temporarily accumulate water to reduce flood risk downstream along Galisteo Creek and along the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  In addition to the project\u2019s main purpose of flood risk reduction, it is also authorized for sediment detention.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although the Galisteo Dam project has successfully reduced flooding, it does not eliminate all flood risk caused by rain downstream of the dam or caused by large flows from the project.  Larger flows passing through the project\u2019s ungated outlet works could surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along Galisteo Creek and the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled spillway flow has never occurred, flow through the spillway could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along Galisteo Creek and the Rio Grande, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  Impacted communities include Santo Domingo Pueblo, San Felipe Pueblo, Algodones, Bernalillo, Pueblo of Sandia Village, low lying areas in Corrales and Albuquerque, Isleta Pueblo, Los Lunas, Socorro, and small communities located in between.\n\nUSACE conducted a risk assessment of the Galisteo Dam project in 2018.  Preliminary results characterize dam breach risk as LOW due to the combination of life loss consequences and low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the result of an extreme event.  Specifically, the occurrence of dam breach caused by overtopping the dam as the consequence of an extreme storm event (1 in 10,000 year or 0.01% chance per year) was identified.  The annual probability of dam breach due to overtopping caused by an extreme event is estimated to be low (1 in 2,000,000).  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation would be life-threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  Impacted communities include Santo Domingo Pueblo, San Felipe Pueblo, Algodones, Bernalillo, Pueblo of Sandia Village, low lying areas in Corrales and Albuquerque, Isleta Pueblo, Los Lunas, Socorro, and communities located in between.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquakes or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included road grading and erosion repairs; vegetation removal from the embankment and reservoir area; and debris removal from the upstream trash rack and downstream channel.  Future risk communication activities include revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and development of a formal risk communication plan.  Flood warnings to notify affected communities downstream of the project are coordinated with external entities.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Waco Dam in June 1965 in accordance with the Flood Control Act, approved on 3 September 1954 (Public Law 780, 83rd Congress, 2nd Session). It is located approximately 2 miles west of the City of Waco in McLennan County, Texas. The dam reduces the risk of downstream flooding along the Bosque River by holding back waters during heavy rain events. The dam is an earthen dam, approximately 3.3 miles long, with both a gated concrete spillway in the middle as well as a gated concrete conduit on the southern end. The gated spillway is controlled by fourteen tainter gates that hold water to 14 feet below the top of the dam to regulate water storage and releases. The gated concrete conduit, or pipe through the dam, is also for releasing water in a regulated manner during and after flood events. There are two low-flow conduits on either side of the concrete conduit for water supply releases. Additional benefits of the dam are recreation and fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Waco Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Waco Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment in April 2024 and classified the risks associated with the project as moderate. This classification is based on an extremely unlikely flood event which could cause several equally unlikely scenarios including instability of the concrete gated spillway structure, instability of the non-overflow portion of the gated concrete spillway, or water to seep through the dam at the left abutment of the concrete gated spillway, through the main section of the dam, or through the southern end of the dam. In the remote event of a dam breach, the largest impacts would be to the city of Waco, TX, located approximately 7 miles downstream of the dam. In any of these unlikely scenarios, downstream flooding in Waco, TX would occur within five hours of breach and could be as deep as a three-story structure, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Waco Dam through the gated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and the spillway gates are opened to allow excess water to flow through the spillway. Surcharge releases through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a two-story building. Although the large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans, and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Bluestone Dam in December 1948. The project was first authorized by Executive Order 7183 in September 1935 and the Flood Control Acts of 1936 and 1938 for the purposes of flood control and is managed by the Huntington District, USACE.\n\nThe concrete dam is 165 feet tall and is nearly a half mile long as it spans the New River valley. Bluestone Dam helps regulate waters coming from a 4600 square-mile basin upstream of the dam. This basin is drained by the New River which starts North Carolina and crosses southwestern Virginia before coming into West Virginia. Bluestone Dam is located directly upstream of city of Hinton, Summers County, West Virginia on the New River. The dam is located approximately 1 mile above the confluence of the Greenbrier River with the New River. Continuing downstream, the New River joins the Gauley River and turns into the Kanawha River which empties into the Ohio River.\n\nIn regulating these waters, Bluestone Dam\u2019s primary function is to reduce flood risks throughout the New and Kanawha River Valleys, including to river-front communities in Summers, Raleigh, Fayette, Kanawha, Putnam, and Mason counties in West Virginia. West Virginia communities that benefit from Bluestone Dam include but are not limited to Hinton, Thurmond, Kanawha Falls, Montgomery, Cabin Creek, the state capitol of Charleston, St. Albans, Winfield, Buffalo, and Point Pleasant. Bluestone Dam also reduces flood risks to communities along the Ohio River both up and downstream it\u2019s the confluence with Kanawha River at Point Pleasant.\n\nBluestone Dam routinely releases New River waters to keep downstream rivers flowing. However, when it is projected that the New, Kanawha or Ohio rivers may cause flooding, water coming from upstream of the dam is captured until swollen streams and rivers downstream of the dam recede and these captured storm waters can be released to reduce flood impacts downstream.\nThe dam has two spillways designed to release water. The primary spillway is made up of 16 tunnels near the base of the dam that are designed to release water on an everyday basis. The top of the spillway has 21 steel crest gates which can help store extreme storm waters. In the event of a very rare storm event, such as a Hurricane, these steel gates can be raised to release or spill these waters to reduce the chance that dam would be overtopped. To date, these 21 crest gates have not had to release extreme storm waters.\n\nWater released thru either the 16 tunnels or 21 crest gates flows through a primary stilling basin prior to entering the New River. This primary stilling basin uses a 23 feet deep lake impounded by a smaller dam located approximately 200 ft downstream of the larger Bluestone Dam. The New River bedrock is currently uncovered between the main dam and this smaller dam. The 23 feet deep lake helps to calm the energy created by water released from the dam. The water energy needs to be reduced so it does not scour the exposed bedrock within the 23 feet lake as well as downstream of the dam. Scour of this rock could undermine and fail the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "While Bluestone Dam greatly reduces flood risks downstream, it does not eliminate these risks. Flooding can still occur even if Bluestone Dam is operating as designed. There are rare but probable storms, like hurricanes, which cause more rainfall than Bluestone Dam can store safely. While hurricanes regularly occur in North Carolina, to affect Bluestone Dam, they would have to drop significant rainfall in the New River basin which is in the northwestern corner of the state, away from the coast. While this reduces the likelihood of a storm impacting this basin, in some rare occasions, conditions could lead to flows greater than 1 million cfs, which is greater than ten times Niagara Falls.\n\nThe dam\u2019s primary and auxiliary spillways pass these events to keep Bluestone Dam from overtopping and failing. When passing these events, flooding is likely in all river-front communities in the New and Kanawha River valleys and potentially the Ohio River valley as well. Depending on the amount of water released during these events, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.\n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach hillside to hillside quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location. In the unlikely event Bluestone Dam must pass these extreme waters, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.\nSince 2000, USACE has made significant investments in Bluestone Dam to help ensure it continues to provide benefits to the public and significantly reduce the chance it would fail. These investments are scheduled to be completed by 2030. The remaining work is focused reinforcing the primary stilling basin to be able to safely pass extreme outflows. Modeling indicates that the primary spillway\u2019s 23 feet deep stilling basin, cannot properly reduce the energy created from the crest gates releasing waters. The energy created by the water releases is likely to fail the primary stilling basin causing the bedrock beneath the dam to become unstable, which could cause the dam to fail.\n\nThis concern with the primary stilling basin is most likely to realize during the passage of rare storms when flooding is already occurring downstream. However, if the dam were to fail, the flooding downstream would dramatically increase. Specifically, warning times would be reduced, and the volume of water and debris carried by the releases would be more like a tidal wave or tsunami increasing the risk to life and property. In the unlikely event the dam was to fail during one of these extreme events, it is critical that you heed all evacuation orders immediately to protect your life.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with federal, state, and local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE also works closely with state and federal emergency agencies to ensure awareness of rare storm events and potential impacts. All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase this monitoring during lake levels rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.\n\nSignificant construction, started in 2000, has increased the dam\u2019s ability to safely store storm waters with the installation of hundreds of anchors as well as increase its ability to discharge extreme storm waters by adding an auxiliary stilling basin. Work continues to reinforce the primary stilling basin to safely pass rare storm events without failing the dam. Construction includes installing new concrete in the primary spillway\u2019s, 23 feet deep stilling basin. This work includes protecting exposed rock with several feet of reinforced and anchored concrete and installing state of the art features, call super-cavitating baffles, to help calm the energy of extreme outflows and protect the dam\u2019s integrity. This work is anticipated to be complete by 2030.\n\nFor additional information on construction work, please visit:\nhttps://www.lrh.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Current-Projects/Bluestone-DSA/",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "DA risk assessment of Birch Hill Dam was last completed in 2016 and has identified the risks associated with the dam as Low. This classification is based primarily on the low likelihood of failure of the dam and catastrophic flooding occurring and impacting the population living downstream of the dam. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to the surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Birch Hill Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillways during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are three extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would result in failure of the dam and downstream flooding: (1) Failure of the main spillway, resulting in a surge of water flowing through the opening created by a missing portion or portions of the spillway structure, and (2) water seeping through the earth embankment and/or the bedrock foundation resulting in voids in the dam as the soil erodes, potentially weakening the dam. Were either of these events to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Athol, and Orange, MA, are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities further downstream, including Greenfield, and Northampton, MA would also be impacted, but less so. \n\nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges. In a worst-case scenario, water could be almost as high as a two-story building.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists at Birch Hill Dam and under normal circumstances, there is very low risk to the public.  Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume normal operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we will take actions to reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of Birch Hill Dam and will modify operations, if necessary, to lower risk to the public. We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam. We will also continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed the construction of Deer Creek Dam in 1968. The project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938, Public Law 75-761. The authorized project purposes include flood control, water conservation, recreation, and fish and wildlife management. Water quality control was later added as an authorized project purpose by the Federal Water Pollution Act of 1948 as amended under section 2 of Public Law 87-88 in July 1961\n\nDeer Creek Dam is located on Deer Creek in Pickaway County, Ohio, about 21 miles upstream from Deer Creek\u2019s confluence with the Scioto River and 105.8 miles from the confluence with the Ohio River. The dam is 5.4 miles northwest of Williamsport, Ohio and 22 miles northwest of Chillicothe. New Holland Dike is located about 3.8 miles southwest of Deer Creek Dam. The village of New Holland is 1.38 miles downstream of the dike. The authorized project purposes include flood control, water conservation, recreation, and fish and wildlife management. This project has prevented over $102.8 million in flood damages between its completion in 1968 and 2013, resulting in average yearly flood damage prevention of $2,200,000.\n\nDeer Creek Dam is a low hazard potential dam at a length of 3,880 feet and a height of 95 feet. The low hazard potential means it is unlikely to result in loss of human life and significant economic loses if breached. It is comprised of a concrete gravity dam with an earthen embankment on either side and controls a drainage area of 277 square miles. Normal flow is passed through sluice gates in the dam, and the dam is outfitted with a Tainter gate controlled overflow spillway for flood control.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although Deer Creek Dam has historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event. This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillway.  In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam's construction.\n\nA 2018 risk assessment for Deer Creek Dam and New Holland Dike classified both as having low risk of failure during a flood. Although risks associated with a breach or failure are low, the dam does not completely eliminate flood risks downstream.  Flooding can still occur even if Deer Creek Dam is operating as designed.  There are extremely rare (but possible) storms that could cause more rainfall than the dam can safely store.  During such an event, the dam has the potential to pass up to 125,000 cubic feet of water per second.  The amount of flow would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching. \n\nThe Deer Creek Dam spillway has never been utilized, if operated it could result in\nsignificant flooding. Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, and critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along Deer Creek may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows. Although the odds of such a storm event occurring are considered extremely unlikely, Deer Creek Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any unanticipated scenarios were to occur.\n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach high elevations quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Deer Creek Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Deer Creek Dam and New Holland Dike. The project is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam and dike during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has specialized instrumentation and a monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam and dike Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Raystown Lake which provides water quality, hydropower and recreation benefits.  Releases are made through the hydropower plant, a gated spillway and a gated conduit.  The project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.  A small earthen embankment named Hesston Dike is associated with the project and is located near the town of Hesston, PA.  This dike is listed separately within the National Inventory of Dams and, during large floods, blocks water from flowing out of Raystown Lake at an area of low ground.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Raystown Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillways during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillways release water to the Raystown Branch Juniata River.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the spillways could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or  unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Huntingdon, Mapleton, Mt. Union, Lewistown, Shirleysburg, and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Juniata River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Raystown Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "Lewisville Dam, which was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1955, provides numerous benefits for the surrounding area. The dam was designed to reduce the risk of downstream flooding to the communities of Lewisville, Carrollton, Irving, and Dallas. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $54.5 billion (adjusted to 2020 dollars). In 1991, hydropower was added as a project purpose and was installed by the City of Denton to supplement the regional power distribution network. In addition, Lewisville reservoir is a principal municipal water source for the city of Dallas and offers a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities. The main components of the dam are an earthen embankment, which serves as the main water barrier composed of compacted earth; lifting gates that are operated to control water releases at the dam; a concrete ungated spillway that allows water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir exceed the available flood storage; and a powerhouse that can provide enough electricity to power 2,400 homes. Lewisville Dam is over six miles long and 125 feet tall and is made up of impervious (watertight) clays and shale. The top of the ungated spillway is about three stories lower than the highest part of the dam and when the reservoir water level exceeds the dedicated flood storage levels, the ungated spillway can pass up to 1.6 million gallons of water per second which is enough water to flood a football field almost four feet deep every second. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir until the swollen streams and rivers below the dam recede and can handle the release of stored water without damage to lives, property, and negative impacts to the environment. Sometimes water must be released to protect the dam\u2019s integrity even though streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Lewisville Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding due to floodwaters passed through Lewisville Dam are high volume releases from the dam during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded causing flooding in areas adjacent to the reservoir and excess water flows through the spillway and/or outlet works. Lewisville Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. Generally, the Elm Fork Trinity River's large floods are long-duration type lasting weeks or even months; however, it is possible that large peak and volume floods could occur in about two weeks duration. Despite the flood reduction benefits the dam provides, very rare, severe storms could still produce high surcharge releases with the potential to exceed the capacity of the downstream levees and impact the communities of Lewisville, Coppell, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving, and Dallas.\n\nIn October 2014, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment to evaluate the potential hazards to the dam, expected performance, and associated consequences. The risk assessment classified the risks associated with the Lewisville Dam as high. The classification is based on an extremely unlikely flood event, unlike anything ever experienced by the project, that could lead to a dam breach or large flows over the spillway and potentially to instability of the structure, eventually breaching the dam. In either scenario, downstream flood waters would be deep and move swiftly through the cities located along the Trinity River in Denton and Dallas Counties, including downtown Dallas. This flooding due to dam breach could overflow levees and cause catastrophic damage to buildings and critical infrastructure. Flooded river depths immediately downstream of the dam could exceed the height of a four-story building. Additionally, there would be flood impacts experienced along the Trinity River all the way to the Gulf of America. Although large downstream communities have thorough, well- practiced emergency action plans; local emergency managers who are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure; local emergency managers who meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events; and a community that is aware of the remote potential for flooding, if a breach of the dam were to occur thousands of people\u2019s lives would be at risk within the inundated area. The USACE is currently constructing dam modifications to reduce the likelihood of breach associated with the risk driving factors identified during the risk assessment.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes; regularly updating the Lewisville Dam Emergency Action Plan; and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as clearing vegetation from the sides of the dam, conducting regular surveillance of the dam, and automating instrumentation to track the performance of the dam. USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and increased surveillance during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Instrumentation and monitoring systems allow USACE staff to monitor the dam for changing conditions that may not be seen at the surface. The frequency of these dam inspections increases when the lake level rises. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.\n\nRisk Management of Lewisville Dam is also a priority for USACE at the national level which has led to the design and current construction of dam safety modifications to address deficiencies identified for Lewisville Dam. While the probability of failure is remote, the risk to human life and property should failure occur is high enough to warrant remediation of the identified deficiencies. The actions being taken to address the deficiencies include constructing a downstream inverted filter berm and seepage collection trenches at two locations, anchoring the spillway weir and constructing an upstream cutoff, overlay the apron on the downstream side of the spillway, and construct a barrier wall downstream of the spillway. In addition, further measures are being taken to reduce risk by adding a filter around the outlet conduit to reduce the possibility of erosion, constructing an upstream berm to address slope stability issues, and partnering with the City of Lewisville to relocate waterlines that previously encroached on the embankment to reduce risk of embankment erosion from a waterline rupture. Additional information on the dam safety modification to Lewisville Dam is available on the USACE Fort Worth District website at the following web address: https://www.swf.usace.army.mil/Home/Lewisville-Lake-Dam/",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. Rend Lake Dam is a high hazard potential dam located on the Big Muddy River, 103.7 miles upstream of its confluence with the Mississippi River. Rend Lake Dam along with the southern half of the lake is located in Franklin County while the northern portion of the lake is located in Jefferson County Illinois. Rend Lake Dam is approximately 10 miles north-west of the City of Benton, Illinois and 75 miles southeast of St. Louis Missouri. The project authority is the Flood Control Act of 23 October 1962, House Document No. 541, 87th Congress, Second Session and amended by Public Law 88-122, eighty eighth congress. Construction of the project began in June 1965 and finished on 15 December 1971. The river was diverted through the outlet works on 1 September 1970 and filling of the reservoir began on 24 October 1970. The desired interim pool elevation was first reached on 23 February 1971 and reached full pool on 12 March 1973. The authorized project purposes include flood control, water supply, downstream water quality, recreation, fish and wildlife conservation, and area redevelopment.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Rend Lake Dam is a high hazard dam categorized as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 4 based on the 2021 risk assessment which is considered low urgency in that there is low incremental risk. The dam reduces the risk to flooding to surrounding and downstream communities but does not eliminate all the risk. During large rainfall events the dam may reach thresholds when large quantities of water will have to be released that cause flooding downstream to prevent inducing additional risk even though the dam is performing as designed. In extremely rare conditions three modes of failure were identified in the risk assessment. In the unlikely scenario when the dam gets overtopped, or erosion of foundation material occurs during extreme precipitation and pool conditions could potentially lead to a breach. In a less likely situation the releases from the auxiliary spillway cause the spillway to fail and allow a breach or partial loss of pool.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam which include inundation maps that have been released to the public via NID. \nIn addition to emergency preparedness routine instrumentation, inspections, and risk assessments are conducted and increased surveillance occurs when hazards exceed pre-established thresholds to ensure the structures are performing as designed. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Subject matter experts are monitoring the weather, expected precipitation, regional conditions, and pool conditions to anticipate impacts, make projections, and advise on deviations in order to further reduce the risk of an extreme loading event.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Kinzua Dam across the Allegheny River to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in the low-lying communities on the Allegheny River, including Warren, Oil City, Franklin, metropolitan Pittsburgh in Allegheny, \tWestmoreland and Armstrong Counties and additional towns on the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.  The dam is located about eight miles upstream of Warren, Pennsylvania and forms the Allegheny Reservoir.  Kinzua dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $1.3 billion between 1966 and 2020. The reservoir stores rainfall from late winter through early summer and releases water to maintain river flow during the drier late-summer and early-autumn months; provides water to an adjoining hydropower facility and provides numerous opportunities for recreation.  Kinzua Dam is composed of both a concrete portion and an earthen (embankment) portion and has a maximum height of almost 180 feet and a length of more than 1800 feet.  The concrete portion of the dam has spillway gates designed to release a large volume of water during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Kinzua dam was completed in 2023, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as high.  The dam was well-constructed and is well-maintained.  However, large populations live downstream of Kinzua dam, including those in Warren, Oil City, Franklin, metropolitan Pittsburgh and other low-lying communities on the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers. Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding to these communities, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from Kinzua Dam would be a high-volume release of reservoir water through the dam\u2019s spillway during an unusually large and intense storm event (which has not occurred since the project was constructed in 1966).  Water released through the spillway would create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam had not been constructed.  \n\nA less likely, but far more devastating flooding scenario exists: an extreme rainfall event that results in water flowing over the earthen embankment portion of the dam, eroding the embankment, and leading to a breach.  Although such a precipitation event leading to a breach is extremely rare, it is a possibility.  Another potential outcome is that the concrete portion of the dam could become unstable during an extreme rainfall event leading to a breach. \n\nIn either scenario, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Communities, including Warren, that are closer to the dam, are in more immediate danger of a significant flood event and may have little advanced warning.  Cities and communities further downstream of the dam, such as Oil City, Franklin, and communities in metropolitan Pittsburgh have larger populations and possibly less awareness of the dam but will have more warning. \n\nWith either of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, possibly overflowing levees (including those in Warren, Oil City, and Kittanning, Pennsylvania; Wellsville, Ohio; and Benwood, West Virginia), destroying buildings and infrastructure.  Anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We are beginning to study whether there are additional measures that we can take to reduce the risk associated with high reservoir levels overflowing onto the earthen portion of the dam.  We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high reservoir levels.  Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high reservoir level is forecast, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses.  We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current and forecasted lake levels at Pittsburgh District reservoirs are available to the public via the internet at:  https://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Portals/72/docs/WaterManagement/ResSumPlots.pdf.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates have been developed for this dam. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "Fern Ridge Dam is located on the Long Tom River 13 miles upstream of Monroe, Oregon and 24 miles upstream of the confluence of the Long Tom and Willamette Rivers. Fern Ridge Dam is a 50 ft tall, 6,330 ft long earthen embankment dam built on a soil foundation with a concrete spillway, six spillway gates, a gated regulating outlet, and two earthen auxiliary dikes. Fern Ridge Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1940 and was completed in 1942. In 2005, the downstream portions of the earthen embankment were completely reconstructed to address concerns with seepage through the embankment\u2019s soil foundation. The reconstruction included installation of a drainage system to collect seepage through the foundation and instrumentation to monitor the drainage system's performance during normal reservoir operations and during flood events. Fern Ridge Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, water quality and hydropower. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project (WVP.) Fern Ridge is one of four WVP dams that do not include a powerhouse.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season.\n\nFern Ridge Dam is located about 50 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. USACE performed a routine risk assessment for Fern Ridge Dam in 2020 that characterizes the risk associated with the dam to be Moderate.\n\nThe assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. The risk at Fern Ridge Dam is driven primarily by the potential for an earthquake occurring at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest. The Cascadia Subduction Zone fault can produce very large earthquakes that can cause up to 3 to 5 minutes of ground shaking. The last subduction zone earthquake occurred in 1700. Fern Ridge Dam has never experienced a large earthquake, but because of its proximity to the Cascadia Subduction Zone and its soil foundation, the earthen embankment dam at Fern Ridge Dam is expected to experience stronger shaking from a Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake than the other Willamette Valley Projects. It is difficult to predict the exact amount of damage or settlement that could occur to a dam as a result such an earthquake. A large earthquake could cause the earthen dam to settle, resulting in water overtopping the dam. The speed and depth of water overtopping a damaged dam could erode the soil that forms the dam and cause flooding downstream. The shaking from an earthquake could also open up cracks through the earthen embankment, allowing water to flow through the dam. The force and speed of the flowing water through a crack in the earthen embankment could cause the dam to be further damaged by eroding away the embankment material, resulting in uncontrolled release of water from the reservoir, and flooding areas downstream. The flooding would be most severe in the agricultural lands between the dam and the confluence with the Willamette River, between Monroe and Corvallis, Oregon.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is further addressing the risk at Fern Ridge Dam by pursuing an advanced risk assessment of the earthen embankment's response to earthquake shaking so that potential damages are better understood. This will help inform the likelihood of an uncontrolled release of water following an earthquake and whether there is a need to pursue long-term risk reduction measures. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Fern Ridge Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Fern Ridge Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The Painted Rock Dam was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) between 1957-59 for flood risk management.  It is located on the Gila River in Maricopa County, California about 20 miles northwest of the town of Gila Bend.  Painted Rock Dam consists of an earthen main embankment, two saddle dikes, a gated outlet works, and a detached broad-crested spillway. The main embankment is 181 feet above the original streambed and is 4,796 feet long.  The left saddle dike is 1,000 feet south of the main embankment and is 525 feet long.  The right saddle dike is located between the east abutment of the main embankment and the spillway and is 200 feet long.  The detached broad-crested spillway is located about 600 feet northeast of the main embankment and has a crest length of 620 feet.  The outlet works is located in the east abutment of the main embankment and consists of an approach channel, gated intake structure, outlet conduit, and outlet channel.  The length of the outlet works is 1,108 feet. The project reduces the risk of flooding to the communities of Yuma, Wellton, Gadsden, and Somerton in Arizona and the Imperial Valley in California.  The project also provides flood protection to highways, to transcontinental railroads, and to agriculture lands.",
    "riskCharSummary": "A risk assessment of Painted Rock Dam was completed in 2022 and classified the risk as very high.  Although unlikely, risk is driven by four potential failure modes.  Risk of the main dam embankment are primarily driven by the potential for overtopping of the dam embankment, loss of the spillway sill and wall, and concentrated leak erosion along the rock knob.  Risk at the project Saddle Dike is driven by the potential for overtopping.  The primary consequences centers are Yuma, AZ and Mexicali, Mexico.  The estimated population at risk is between 726,000 and 917,000.  Economic consequences are estimated to be more than $6 Billion.\n\nTo further an understanding of the risk posed by Painted Rock Dam, USACE has begun a higher-level risk assessment, an Issue Evaluation Study (IES), to better define the risks posed.  The IES is underway and will focus on overtopping modeling, field investigations, and detailed analysis of the erosion potential of the main embankment.  While this study continues, USACE has begun elevated Emergency Preparedness by conducting a Tabletop Planning Exercise in Yuma, AZ and coordination meetings with Mexican officials.  Continued emergency planning will be conducted to inform and prepare first responders as these studies continue.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure USACE is taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises and incorporating any new information into our Emergency Action Plan. USACE closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. USACE is working with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents and schools to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase this monitoring during lake level rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Future risk communication activities include updates to the Emergency Action Plan and coordinating these plans first responders and development of a formal Risk Communication Plan.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "Santa Fe Dam is located on the San Gabriel River in the City of Irwindale, Los Angeles County, California.  The dam was authorized to provide flood risk management for the densely populated area between the dam site and the downstream Whittier Narrows Reservoir.  The project was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and was completed in January 1949.  Santa Fe Dam is situated along the San Gabriel River approximately one and a half miles downstream of the Foothill Blvd Bridge and four miles southwest of the San Gabriel Canyon.  The project consists of an earthen embankment, intake tower and gated outlet works, and an uncontrolled spillway.  The top of dam length is 23,800 feet, and the dam has a height of 92 feet above streambed.  Water is moved through the structure via two means: 1) an intake structure with outlet works consisting of 16 separate gated conduits 2) an uncontrolled spillway structure located on the right side of the embankment.  The Santa Fe Dam and Reservoir is dry unless a significant rainfall event occurs, normally between the months of November and April.",
    "riskCharSummary": "A risk assessment of the Santa Fe Dam was completed by USACE in 2016.  The risks identified during this study determined the dam to be a moderate risk due to the combination of life, economic, or environmental consequences with likelihood of failure to be unacceptable except in unusual circumstances.  The project risk is driven by the high population at risk immediately downstream o the dam as well as identified potential failure modes.  The primary risk drivers for Santa Fe Dam are internal erosion of the earthen embankment adjacent to the outlet conduit and impacts on the structure due to an earthquake event.  The primary consequence centers are the cities of Irwindale, Baldwin Park, El Monte, and South El Monte which are located downstream and between the Santa Fe Dam and Whittier Narrows Dam.  These areas are heavily developed and will be significantly impacted as a result of flooding scenarios.  The population at risk is over 100,000 and economic consequences would be significant.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Somerville Dam in December 1967 in accordance with the Flood Control Act approved 3 September 1954 (Public Law 780, 83rd Congress, 2nd Session), and in accordance with the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers contained in House Document No. 535 (81st Congress, 2nd Session) \u201cReport of Survey of Brazos River and Tributaries, Texas, Oyster Creek, Texas and Jones Creek, Texas\u201d. Somerville Dam is located immediately upstream of the town of Somerville, Texas at river mile 20 on Yegua Creek and reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities by holding back waters during heavy rain events until they can be released without damage to lives, property or the environment. Somerville Lake is operated as part of the Brazos River Basin System, providing flood protection along the Brazos River and its tributaries. The sponsoring agency is the Brazos River Authority (BRA). The dam consists of an earthen embankment and dike that holds water in the reservoir, rising stem sluice gates that are operated to release water in a regulated manner during and after flood events, and an uncontrolled ogee weir spillway which holds water to 22\u2010feet below the top of the dam to allow water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir become high. The dam embankment is made up of soil and rock and is approximately 80 feet high (about 8 stories) at a crest elevation of 280.1 feet (NAVD88 vertical datum control). The earthen dike, located west of the spillway, is 20 feet tall and 4,715 feet in length. The reservoir is kept at or below the conservation pool elevation of 238.1 feet NAVD88 for most of the year. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir and releases are made in accordance with the water control manual. Somerville Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, Somerville Dam is also utilized for water supply, recreation, and environmental benefits. These benefits significantly improve the quality of life in the area.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Even though Somerville Dam reduces the risk of flooding to the downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. USACE Fort Worth District completed a risk assessment for Somerville Dam in April 2018 that characterizes the risk associated with the project as moderate. This classification is primarily based upon events involving the possibility of; (1) concentrated leak erosion of the embankment core material into the downstream embankment at the Main Dam; (2) concentrated leak erosion along the left abutment embankment contact; and/or (3) embankment material eroding into fractures and openings in the foundation rock near an inactive fault. Also, the dam overtops during extreme flood events. Due to lack of as\u2010built construction documentation, there is significant uncertainty regarding the physical characteristics of the dam as related to these types of failure mechanisms. Although Somerville Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall and hurricane events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates in accordance with the water control manual, downstream flooding is possible during very large rain events, necessitating large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and uncontrolled spillway. In the remote event of a dam breach, the largest impacts would be to the city of Somerville, TX, located immediately downstream of the dam. In any of these unlikely scenarios, downstream flooding in Somerville, TX would occur within 30 minutes of breach and could reach 16.7 feet above the top of bank, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. Although local communities have well\u2010practiced emergency action plans and local emergency managers meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, including the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To lower the risks associated with the dam, inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam. Surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Routine maintenance and dam safety monitoring are performed to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. Somerville Dam is well maintained with an instrumentation and monitoring system, allowing USACE staff the ability to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. In 2018, the Vicksburg District cleaned the relief well system to maintain its efficiency and meet current guidelines for frequency of cleaning relief wells. The USACE is currently assessing the necessity for cleaning the relief well system on this recurring 5\u2010year interval based on modern\u2010day seepage analyses. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as stockpiling materials for emergency flood fighting; monitoring structural movement and settlement through drone topographic surveys; cleaning, inspecting, and maintaining project instrumentation; dewatering and inspecting the outlet works and spillway stilling basins; evaluating the need to install new instrumentation; repairing the spillway drainage system; inspecting the conduit; and repairing/replacing outlet works gates. USACE Fort Worth District works closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize time for evacuation and designating evacuation routes; regularly update the Somerville Dam Emergency Action Plan; conduct emergency exercises with state and local response teams, and annually communicate risks associated with Somerville Dam with stakeholders and Emergency Managers.",

    "projectDescription": "Delaware Dam was designed and built by the Huntington District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938, Public No. 761, Seventy-fifth Congress, Third Session on 28 June 1938 as part of a comprehensive flood control plan for the Ohio River Basin.  Delaware Dam and Reservoir is located 32.4 miles above the mouth of the scenic Olentangy River, a tributary of the Scioto River near Delaware, Ohio.  The dam is a multipurpose dam designed for flood reduction, pollution reduction, water supply, water quality control, recreation, and fish and wildlife management.  It was constructed between 1947 and 1951 and is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntington District.  At a length of 18,600 feet and a height of 92 feet with a concrete spillway, Delaware Dam controls a drainage area of 381 square miles. Cumulative flood damages prevented are about $124 million over the project life and average about $2.3 million annually.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although the Delaware Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates.  In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam's construction.  \n\nUS Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Delaware Dam in September 2018 and classified the risk associated with failure as High to Moderate.  Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, Delaware Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any unanticipated scenarios were to occur.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts numerous activities daily to manage risks at both Delaware Dam and Waldo Levee. Both infrastructures are well-maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities. Detailed inspections of Delaware Dam and the Waldo Levee system are carried out during normal lake levels and flood events.\n\nTo supplement these inspections, both sites have specialized instrumentation and monitoring systems. These allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions and examine the dam during high water conditions at Waldo Levee. Risk management and emergency response actions are bolstered by conducting emergency exercises and dam/levee safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Furthermore, Emergency Action Plans for both locations are routinely updated to improve emergency response actions, and flood fighting materials are stored onsite at Delaware Dam and nearby Waldo Levee in case of an emergency.",

    "projectDescription": "Carbon Canyon dam was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to provide flood risk management in the Carbon Canyon Creek drainage basin.  Construction of the dam was completed in 1961.  The dam is located on Carbon Canyon Creek in the city of Brea, California adjacent to the boundary with Yorba Linda, California in northern Orange County.  Carbon Canyon Creek flows in a generally southwestern direction onto the coastal Orange County Plain, joining Coyote Creek before flowing into the San Gabriel River.  The project includes an earthen embankment and adjoining earthen saddle dike, a detached uncontrolled spillway, and an outlet works that includes a conduit, control tower, and hydraulic gates operated to control releases during high water events.  The earthen embankment has a top of dam length of 1,860 feet and a height of 69 feet above streambed.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The USACE conducted a dam safety risk assessment of the Carbon Canyon Dam that was completed in 2020 and classified the dam as high risk.  The combination of life or economic consequences with the likelihood of failure is high and USACE considers this level of life-risk to be unacceptable except in extraordinary circumstances.  The assessment identified the potential for internal erosion of the embankment along the outlet conduit and along the wastewater line in the dam to be the primary factors driving the risk.  Seismic concerns with impacts from earthquakes were evaluated and determined to not contribute to the risk.  The primary consequence centers downstream are Brea, Yorba Linda, Fullerton, Placentia, and Anaheim, California.  The population at risk due to a dam failure would be approximately 100,000 in these communities, and significant economic consequences would be expected if a failure were to occur.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure USACE is taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises and incorporating any new information into our Emergency Action Plan. USACE closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. USACE is working with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents and schools to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase this monitoring during lake level rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Future risk communication activities include updates to the Emergency Action Plan and coordinating these plans first responders and development of a formal Risk Communication Plan.  USACE has also recommended initiation of a Dam Safety Modification Study to develop alternatives to address the potential for erosion along the conduit and wastewater line.",

    "projectDescription": "Flood control structures at the Wills Creek Lake Project include an embankment dam, an uncontrolled spillway adjacent to the right abutment, and outlet works at the left abutment.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities; however, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Although Wills Creek Dam has historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event.  An event such as this could require unusually large quantities of water to be released. \n\nA 2019 risk assessment for Wills Creek Dam classified the risk of failure for the entire project system as low.  The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the uncontrolled spillway to the right of the dam has the potential to pass up to twenty-five thousand cubic feet of water per second.   The uncontrolled spillway is designed to pass water to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.\n\nWhile the Wills Creek Dam spillway has flowed.  If operated near its full capacity, it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Dresden, OH to Zanesville, OH.  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along Wills  Creek and the Muskingum River, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows.  Although the odds of such a storm even occurring are considered extremely unlikely, Wills Creek Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any unanticipated scenarios were to occur.   \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach high elevations quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Wills Creek Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Wills Creek Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions, and flood fighting materials are stored onsite in case of an emergency.",

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

    "projectDescription": "The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Hannibal Locks and Dam across the Ohio River in 1972.  Hannibal Locks and Dam is located in Hannibal Ohio, about 126  miles downstream from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The dam is concrete and includes a fixed concrete spillway and 8 gated bays through which the river flows.  There is also a privately owned hydropower plant near the left bank and in line with the dam.  The purpose of this dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam to the upstream Pike Island Locks and Dam.  The locks provide a lift of about 21 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool upstream of the dam (upper pool).  The locks allow river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The locks include a main chamber that is 1,200 feet long and 110 feet wide and a second, auxiliary lock chamber that is 600 feet long by 110 feet wide.  The lock chambers are adjacent to each other and are formed on each side by concrete walls and steel lock gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The pool created by the dam also provides water supply for municipal and industrial intakes, hydropower generation, and recreational opportunities for the surrounding communities.  The total benefits to the region are more than 630 million dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2009, which characterized the risk as low. The assessment identified one primary scenario that could cause the dam to fail.  When the river is at normal levels, water seeping around the concrete lock walls could erode the soil behind the walls.  If unchecked, the erosion could progress to the point that the upper pool would be lost (i.e., too low to allow river traffic to continue).  If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequence would be the loss of shipping and recreation, which would damage the regional economy by more than 1.9 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping and boat recreation.  Although this scenario is possible, the dam has performed well for over 50 years without incident or indications that this scenario is occurring.  Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We regularly update our emergency action plan. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The US Army Corps of Engineers completed the construction of Dillon Dam in 1960. The project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938 (Public Law 761, 75th Congress, 3rd Session: H.R. 10618) The authorized project purposes include flood risk management, recreation, fish and wildlife enhancement and low-flow augmentation. The total cost to build the dam was almost $30 Million. It has prevented over $1.5 Billion in flood damages since construction. \n\nDillon Dam is a high hazard dam located in Muskingum County, Ohio, north of Zanesville, Ohio. The Dam is located on the Licking River approximately 8.5 miles above the mouth of the river and 83.4 miles above the mouth of the Muskingum River. Most dams that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages, if breached, would lead to loss of life and/or high economic impacts downstream causing them to be labeled \u201chigh hazard\u201d.  Two dikes, which are a associated structures to Dillon Dam, are located north and northwest of the dam. Those dikes are named Nashport Dike and Pleasant Valley Dike.\n\nThe earthen dam has a length of 1,400 feet and a height of 118 feet. Normal outflow is controlled through gates on the intake structure and flow into a tunnel through the dam\u2019s left abutment. Discharge energy is then dissipated downstream by a conventional jump-type stilling basin. There is one unregulated emergency spillway that would go into operation during extreme flood events to prevent the dam from overtopping.   \n\nThe dam helps regulate waters coming from the Licking River in the 742 square mile drainage area upstream of the dam. The dam helps to provide flood risk management downstream along the Licking River, to the lower section of Zanesville, Ohio, with additional benefits to McConnelsville, Ohio and other points downstream on the Muskingum and Ohio River. Dillon Dam provides waters to keep downstream rivers flowing. However, when it is projected that the Licking River may cause flooding, water coming from upstream of the dam is stored until streams and rivers downstream of the dam recede. Typically storm waters can be released in a controlled manner to reduce flood impacts downstream. However, there are rare storms which can cause more rainfall and runoff than Dillon Dam can store safely. When this occurs, the dam\u2019s uncontrolled spillway will begin to release or spill these waters to reduce the chance that the dam could be overtopped. \n\nWhen the dam is not storing flood waters to reduce flood risks downstream, the dam operates to impound water for flood control, recreation, fish and wildlife enhancement and low-flow augmentation. This lake is raised in the warmer months to support boat access and lowered in the winter months for additional flood storage.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dillon Dam and the associated dikes significantly reduce the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not eliminate the risk. Although Dillon Dam, Nashport Dike, and Pleasant Valley Dike have historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Dillon Dam and associated dikes in 2017 and classified the risk associated with failure for all three as low. This risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam and dikes can safely store. During such an event, the uncontrolled spillway near the left abutment of the dam has the potential to pass 89,200 cubic feet per second. The operation of the spillway would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching. \n\nWhile the Dillon Dam spillway has never flowed, if operated it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Zanesville, Ohio to Marietta, Ohio. In fact, impacts could be seen all the way down to the confluence of the Ohio River.  Furthermore, when the reservoir is high enough to cause spillway flow there would be additional flow upstream of the dam at two low points around the reservoir, near Township Hall and Black Run. Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur. Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along the Licking River may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows. Although the odds of such a storm event occurring are considered extremely unlikely, Dillon Dam and the associated Dikes have an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any unanticipated scenarios were to occur.\n\nIn the unlikely event Dillon Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Dillon Dam, Nashport Dike, and Pleasant Valley Dike. The dam and its connected dikes are well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the project during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineer staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built West Thompson Dam from 1963 to 1965 across the Quinebaug River. The dam holds back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Quinebaug and Thames Rivers. West Thompson Dam normally holds a 13-foot deep, permanent, conservation pool. The dam was built in response to the severe flooding that occurred in the region in 1936. Since it began operations through 2015, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than $92.3 million.\n\nThe dam is made of compacted earth and rock fill and is approximately 7 stories (70 feet) high. A 12-foot diameter concrete pipe called a conduit passes through the dam.  Metal gates at the upstream side of the conduit are opened to allow water to pass through the dam and are closed when water needs to be stored during flood events. To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, water can also be released across the spillway, a sloped concrete structure located on the right abutment of the dam. A spillway is similar in concept to a sink overflow that prevents a sink bowl from completely overflowing. The spillway is approximately the length of a football field and approximately two stories below the top of the dam. One dike (Reardon Road Dike), also composed of earth and rock fill, with an approximate height equivalent to 2 stories (19 feet) were constructed to close off a low area around the reservoir.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of West Thompson Dam in 2016 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Low. This classification is based primarily on the sizeable population living downstream of the dam that could experience catastrophic flooding in the very unlikely event of a failure of the dam. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from West Thompson Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist. \n\nThere are also two extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would result in failure of the dam and downstream flooding:  (1) water from waves intermittently flowing over the earth embankment crest results in erosion of the dam crest, potentially weakening the dam, (2) water seeping through the earth embankment and its foundation results in voids in the dam as the soil erodes, potentially weakening the dam.  Putnam, Danielson, and Jewett City, CT are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities further downstream would also be impacted, but less so. \n\nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges. In a worst case scenario, you could see water greater than a one and half story building.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "No emergency situation currently exists, or is about to occur, at West Thompson Dam. There is very low risk to the public under normal circumstances. Should a crisis occur, we will use our expertise to quickly find a solution to resume normal operations. While we cannot completely eliminate risk, we are taking actions to reduce the risks.  We closely monitor the performance of West Thompson Dam and will modify operations if we feel there is risk to the public. We will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our Emergency Action Plan for the dam. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur so that necessary flood warnings may be issued in a timely manner. USACE is undertaking additional study to further understand the risk associated with West Thompson Dam, and what, if any, actions can be completed to reduce the risk.",

    "projectDescription": "Cougar Dam is located on the South Fork McKenzie River 42 miles upstream of Eugene and Springfield, Oregon. Cougar Dam is a 519 ft tall, 1,600 ft long rockfill earthen embankment dam with a concrete spillway, two spillway gates, an intake structure with regulating outlet, and a powerhouse. Cougar Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1959 and was completed in 1963. Cougar Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at low elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to refill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, produce hydropower, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season.\n\nCougar Dam is located about 100 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. USACE has been conducting advanced risk assessments, called Issue Evaluation Studies (IES), at several Willamette Valley Project dams including Cougar Dam.\n\nThe assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. As of June 2020, results of the advanced study for Cougar Dam identified the risk associated with the dam to be High. The risk is driven by the large population downstream combined with the potential for an extreme earthquake occurring at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest. According to the study, a large earthquake could cause the rockfill earthen dam to settle, resulting in water overtopping the dam. It is difficult to predict the exact amount of settlement that could occur to the dam as a result of such an earthquake. The speed and depth of water overtopping a damaged dam could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam and cause significant flooding downstream. The shaking from an earthquake could also open up cracks through the rockfill earthen dam, allowing water to flow through the dam. The force and speed of the flowing water through the cracks could cause the dam to be further damaged by eroding away the embankment material, resulting in uncontrolled release of water from the reservoir, and flooding areas downstream. Because Cougar Dam is located upstream of Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, there is potential for devastating flooding to affect large downstream populations in urban areas and surrounding suburbs, as well as rural communities in the floodplain and narrow canyons.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The likelihood is low for an extreme earthquake to occur, but the potential impacts of a dam failure are very high due to the large downstream population. USACE continues to evaluate the seismic performance of the embankment to determine if short-term targeted measures (called Interim Risk Reduction Measures), or long-term modifications will be necessary to reduce risk. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Cougar Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Cougar Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) designed and built Norfork Dam between 1940 and 1944 for flood risk management, water supply, water quality control, irrigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife. Norfork Lake and Dam are major units in a comprehensive plan for the development of the water resources of the White River Basin in Missouri and Arkansas. Norfork Dam is in north central Arkansas on the Norfork River, 4.8 miles upstream from its confluence with the White River in Baxter County, Arkansas. Norfork Lake is in Baxter County, Arkansas and Ozark County, Missouri. The lake is one of a series of five lakes in the Upper White River Basin in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri. The nearest communities are Salesvale, Arkansas,1.5 miles downstream; Norfork, Arkansas, 4.5 river miles downstream; Calico Rock, Arkansas, 16.2 river miles downstream; and Batesville, Arkansas, 75 river miles downstream of the dam. \n\nThe main components of the project are a concrete dam section, which serves as the main water barrier; a concrete gated spillway, a segment of the structure used to provide additional controlled release of water from the dam during major flood events; and hydropower facilities.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Norfork Dam in June 2024 that characterizes the risks associated with the project as moderate. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although the Norfork Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall and earthquake events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction. Norfork Dam has an Emergency Action Plan and Risk Reduction Plan in place to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE actively monitors Norfork Dam and implements a comprehensive risk reduction program to address these potential risks. Project personnel receive regular dam safety training, and the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is maintained and updated \u2013 most recently in 2024. Emergency preparedness is reinforced through regular exercises, such as a tabletop exercise conducted in September 2023 with local, state, and federal emergency managers. Additional risk reduction measures include improved communication plans, increased public education, downstream warning systems, and ongoing monitoring of dam performance. These efforts are reviewed annually to ensure their effectiveness in protecting downstream communities.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam.\n\nDuring the latest risk assessment, potential ways the dam could be breached were evaluated.  Broadly, they fell into two categories: wave overwash and various types of soil erosion.  Every mechanism evaluated was believed to have a very low probability of leading to failure: less than one in one million years.  The possible loss of life is between 10 and 300 people if these very unlikely events were to occur.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nTownshend Dam is operated in conjunction with Ball Mountain Dam.  Staff is shared between the two facilities, which are staffed full time.  During high pools, Townshend Dam is inspected on a daily basis.  When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  At very high levels, project staff stays on site for 24 hour watches. Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Eufaula Dam in 1964 with the primary purpose of reducing flooding downstream.  The dam also provides hydroelectric power, water supply, navigation, recreation, sediment control, and fish and wildlife benefits.  Eufaula Dam is located on the Canadian River, approximately 12 miles east of the town of Eufaula, OK and 31 miles south of Muskogee, OK. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream. Water storage and releases are managed by a large gated spillway. The dam also consists of an earthen embankment. The project includes a hydroelectric power plant that began operating in 1964 and generates power for the communities of Okmulgee, Haskell, McIntosh, and Pittsburg Counties Oklahoma State Highway 71 runs across the top of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2017 and classified the risk associated with Eufaula Dam as low. Although extremely unlikely, the primary risks to the integrity of the dam are the potential for: (1) water overflowing the embankment leading to erosion and breach, and (2) the concrete dam section becoming unstable leading to breach. In the remote event of a dam failure, the most immediate impacted areas with the major population center would be the cities of Whitefield, Webbers Falls, and Moffett in Oklahoma, as well as Ft. Smith and Van Buren in Arkansas.  Failure of the dam would result in widespread flooding in these areas resulting in loss of life and damage to infrastructure along the river.\nA more likely flooding scenario includes a large release through the gated spillway during a flood with the project operating as intended.  \n\nAlthough the inundation would not be as great as a breach of the dam, this scenario could still result in widespread economic impacts and loss of life due to the extent of the flooding possible as part of normal operation of the dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk Eufaula Dam poses to the surrounding communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the EAP to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the project. Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the project during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has an instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "Cottage Grove Dam is located on the Coast Fork Willamette River, approximately 5 miles upstream of Cottage Grove, Oregon. Cottage Grove Dam is a 95ft tall, 1,750ft long earthen embankment dam with a 264ft long concrete ungated spillway, and a 96ft wide concrete non-overflow section. Cottage Grove Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1940 and was completed in 1942. Cottage Grove Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project (WVP). Cottage Grove Dam is one of four WVP dams that does not include a powerhouse.\n\nDuring the winter months, the Willamette Valley Project reservoirs are maintained at their lowest elevations to allow for the temporary storage of rain and snow melt. When managing high flow events, the outflow from the system of dams is coordinated to reduce peak flows and river stages at downstream locations. In spring, USACE begins to fill the reservoirs, increasing the amount stored for conservation purposes and reducing the amount available for flood risk management. During summer, stored water is used for recreation on the reservoirs, and some stored water is released in the river downstream to improve water quality, support fish and wildlife habitat, and provide water for irrigation and municipal uses. During dry summer months, flows into the reservoirs are generally less than flows needed to meet minimum flow objectives, causing reservoir levels to drop. In fall, stored water remaining in the reservoir is drawn down to minimum levels in preparation for the flood season.\n\nCottage Grove Dam is about 60 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure. The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. The assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. USACE completed a routine risk assessment for Cottage Grove Dam in 2022. The next routine risk assessment is scheduled to occur in 2032. \n\nThe 2022 risk assessment identified the risk associated with the dam to be \u201cLow.\u201d According to the 2022 assessment, an extreme earthquake could cause damage to the earthen embankment dam leading to erosion of the embankment material or could damage the spillway structure. Because Cottage Grove Dam is located upstream of Cottage Grove, Oregon, there is potential for flooding to affect downstream populations in Cottage Grove as well as rural communities in the floodplain areas.\n\nUSACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Lock and Dam No. 8 across the Monongahela River from 1923 to 1925.  The dam was reconstructed in 1959 and the lock was reconstructed from 1990 to 1993 and the project was renamed Point Marion Lock and Dam.  The dam is located near Point Marion, Pennsylvania, about 91 river miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Morgantown Lock and Dam, which is located near Morgantown, Pennsylvania.  The dam is composed of concrete and has of two concrete spillway sections and six steel gates which allow the river to flow.  The lock provides a lift of 19 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 84 feet wide by 720 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream ends.  The pool created by the dam also provides water supply for the local area and provides recreational opportunities for the region.  The economic benefit of shipping materials and goods through the lock, water supply, and recreation is more than 32 million dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2024, which characterized the risk as very low.  The assessment identified one scenario that could cause the dam to fail.  When the river is at higher-than-normal levels, a runaway barge could become trapped on the dam which could prevent one or more dam gates from closing.  Inability to close the dam gate could drain the upper pool to the extent that river traffic would be halted.  If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequences would be the loss of shipping, water supply, and recreation, which would damage the regional economy by more than 32 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping and boat recreation.  Due to the relatively low height of the dam, which lies entirely within the banks of the Monongahela River, downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communication and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam or that may adversely affect shipping.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications.  We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the Cordell Hull Lock and Dam in March of 1973 with the powerhouse being completed in February 1974.  The dam is located near Carthage, TN on the Cumberland River approximately 313.5 river miles above its confluence with the Ohio River.  Cordell Hull Lock and Dam was authorized by Congress through the River and Harbor Act of 1946, as one of the multipurpose projects in the Corps of Engineers\u2019 coordinated plan for development of the water resources of the Cumberland River Basin.  The dam has a maximum height of 87 feet, a total length of 1,306 feet, and consists of a concrete gravity section, earthen embankment, navigation lock, and powerhouse.  Cordell Hull Dam impounds Cordell Hull Lake which has a total storage capacity of 311,000 acre-ft.  The Congressionally authorized project purposes include navigation, hydropower generation, and recreation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The project risk is currently driven by the consequences of an overtopping failure of the compacted clay embankment.  Consequences from a dam failure are expected to be moderate with the major damage center being Carthage, TN, with Smith, Trousdale, Wilson, Sumner, Davidson and Cheatham counties impacted by the inundation scenarios.  The population at risk is estimated to be less than 10,000.  There are currently no operating restrictions in place and no plans to change how water releases are managed.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase the frequency of this monitoring during lake levels rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "William L Jess (Lost Creek) Dam is located on the main stem of the Rogue River in Jackson County, 10 miles upstream of Shady Cove, Ore., and 28 miles upstream of Medford, Ore. William L Jess Dam is a 327-foort tall 3600-foot long rockfill earthen embankment dam with a concrete spillway, three spillway gates, a multiple-level withdrawal structure, regulating outlet, and powerhouse. The dam was constructed from 1967 to 1977 to provide flood risk management, irrigation, hydroelectric power, and fisheries enhancement. Other purposes include wildlife enhancement, water quality improvement, and recreation. The watershed above William L Jess Dam is 674 square miles and predominantly forest land. \n\nThe dam is operated to reduce flooding during winter and spring months by temporarily holding back inflow to the reservoir and releasing flood waters after unregulated flows subside. William L Jess Dam serves to increase the summer and fall flows of Rogue River and to a lesser extent the navigable portion of the Rogue River by storing water into the drier summer months to provide steady flows for producing hydropower, supporting fish habitat, and providing water for irrigation. The multiple-level withdrawal structure that allows for the regulation of the water temperature released from the reservoir. The gated spillway allows for the passage of large flood events that fill the available flood storage in the reservoir. The spillway was designed to pass a maximum flood flow of approximately 169,000 cfs. The spillway has been used to pass flood flows one time in January 1997 with a maximum discharge measured at 14,300 cfs.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment on William L Jess Dam in 2017 that characterized the life-safety risks associated with the project as Moderate. The risk assessment found the risk to be driven by an unlikely scenario in which an extreme earthquake occurs at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest. In this scenario, an extreme earthquake causes the earthen dam to settle and crack, resulting in water over or through the dam.  The speed and depth of water flowing over and through the damaged dam could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam and cause significant flooding downstream. The strong shaking from such an earthquake could also damage the spillway\u2019s concrete structure and gates, which could result in additional water flow in the river downstream. \n\nWilliam L Jess Dam is located approximately 55 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone can produce very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.  \n\nUSACE is confident that the William L Jess Dam is well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the flood risk management dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The likelihood is low an extreme earthquake to occur that would severely damage William L Jess Dam, but the potential impacts of a dam failure are high due to the population downstream. USACE continues to evaluate the seismic performance of the embankment to determine if short-term targeted measures (called Interim Risk Reduction Measures), or long-term modifications will be necessary to reduce risk. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and William L Jess Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. William L Jess Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on the most recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be very low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates have been developed for this dam since there is potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated.  This dam is authorized, designed, and operated for hydropower and flood damage reduction and stores water for those purposes.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure, downstream flooding would occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to store water to reduce downstream flooding that would occur naturally.   But during a very large flood, flooding woul doccur downstream, and failure would result in additional flooding downstream.  Flood mapping has been developed to indicate potential flooding extents during a range of river conditions for both breach and non-breach conditions. These maps should be used by the public and state and local emergency managers for their awareness and preparedness in the event of a dam breach incident.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Allegheny River Lock and Dam 2 across the Allegheny River in 1934.  The dam is located near Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, about 7 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to C. W. Bill Young Lock and Dam, which is located near Oakmont, Pennsylvania.  The dam consists of a concrete spillway section, which means that the river flows freely over it.  The lock provides a lift of 11 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam to the pool above the dam.  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel lock gates on the upstream and downstream ends.  The economic benefit of shipping materials and goods through the lock is more than 15 million dollars annually.  There are no means of controlling the flow over the dam and the dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.  The pool created by the dam provides recreation opportunities for metropolitan Pittsburgh.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2023, which characterized the risk as very low. The assessment identified one primary scenario that could halt river traffic.  When the river is at normal levels, a crack in one of the miter gates could grow to the extent that it is unusable.  If this occurred, the lock could not convey boats and barges upstream or downstream of the dam and river traffic would be halted.  This would result in a loss of river traffic for more than six weeks. The economic damage would be temporary, until a replacement gate could be installed to allow resumption of shipping and boat recreation.   In this scenario, both the upper pool and lower pool would be unaffected and there would be no resulting flooding on the Allegheny River.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. When we determine that our lock gates are at risk of failure, we take action to replace them and any vulnerable components as quickly as possible.  We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communication and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam or that may adversely affect navigation.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the nearby riverbed, lock, and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications.  We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be very low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates have been developed for this dam since there is potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, flooding nearby could occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding in the canal.  During a large flood, failure of the Fulton Ring Dike (also known as the Fulton Levee) would result in flooding in Fulton.  Flood mapping has been developed to indicate potential flooding extents during a range of river conditions for both breach and non-breach scenarios. These maps should be used by the public and state and local emergency managers for their awareness and preparedness in the event of a dam breach incident.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "Grapevine Dam was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1952 to reduce the risk of downstream flooding to the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex area, as well as to store and supply water to the cities of Dallas and Grapevine. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by an estimated $26.4 billion (adjusted to 2020 dollars). In addition, the Grapevine reservoir offers a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities. Grapevine Dam consists of an earthen embankment that holds water in the reservoir, lifting gates that are operated to control water releases at the dam, and an ungated spillway which allows water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir exceed the available flood storage. Grapevine Dam is made up of rock and soil and has a maximum height of 135 feet. The ungated spillway is made of concrete and used as a safety measure to prevent lake levels from flowing over the top of the dam in extreme conditions. The top of the ungated spillway, or spillway crest, is approximately 20 feet lower than the tallest part of the dam and when the reservoir water level exceeds the dedicated flood storage levels the spillway can pass up to 1.4 million gallons of water per second, or enough water to flood a football field (not including the end zones) more than four feet deep every second. Except for variations due to water supply or flood storage, the reservoir is kept at a constant elevation year-round. Should heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is typically stored in the reservoir until the swollen streams and rivers below the dam recede and can handle the release of stored water without damage to lives, property or the environment. Sometimes water must be released to protect the dam\u2019s integrity even though streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Grapevine Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding due to floodwaters passed through Grapevine Dam is high volume releases through the outlet works and ungated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Grapevine Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. Generally, the Elm Fork Trinity River's large flood duration is long, lasting weeks or even months; however, it is possible that high peak and large volume floods could occur within a two-week duration. Despite the flood reduction benefits the dam provides, very rare, severe storms, much larger than have ever been experienced in the area, could still produce high surcharge releases with the potential to overtop downstream levees and impact the communities of Lewisville, Coppell, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving, and Dallas.\n\nIn May 2019, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment to evaluate the potential hazards to the dam, expected performance, and associated consequences. The risk assessment classified risks associated with Grapevine Dam as moderate. This classification is based on the potential for high life loss and consequences due to unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios than presented above that would produce significant flooding. The first scenario would be an extreme storm event, unlike anything ever experienced in this area, which would cause about a foot of water to flow over the top of the dam embankment.  The water flowing over the top of the dam combined with the spillway discharge would result in flooding downstream that is 20 feet higher in some areas than the flooding experienced during the last major flood in 2015. Downstream flooding, due to water flowing over the dam, would impact communities from Grapevine to Dallas, TX. The same flood event would cause the water level in the lake to rise to 20 feet deeper than the highest recorded pool and localized flooding in the areas surrounding and adjacent to Lake Grapevine would occur prior to the reservoir flowing over the top of the embankment. There is a potential for breach of the dam at reservoir levels leading up to and over the top of the dam caused by water passing over the top of the dam causing erosion, or through the earthen embankment at the ends or under the dam and in the area where the embankment fill surrounds the concrete outlet pipe, creating voids as the soil erodes. In a breach scenario, downstream flood waters would be deep and move swiftly through the downstream cities located along the Trinity River in Tarrant, Denton, and Dallas Counties, including downtown Dallas, likely overflowing levees, and destroying billions of dollars of property. Flooded river depths immediately downstream of the dam could exceed the height of a four-story building. Additionally, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. Flood impacts could be expected along the Trinity River all the way to the Gulf of America. Although large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans, local emergency managers who are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, and local emergency managers who meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, breach of the dam would put thousands of people\u2019s lives at risk who are trapped within the inundated area.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes. The USACE Emergency Action Plan for Grapevine Dam is updated and exercised annually, improving emergency response and coordination between USACE elements and downstream federal, state, county, city agencies, and stakeholders. USACE also communicates risks associated with Grapevine Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers. Inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam, and surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. The performance of Grapevine Dam is also monitored by an automated instrumentation system, allowing USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as clearing vegetation from the sides of the dam, conducting regular surveillance of the dam, assessing the current instrumentation program, managing utility encroachments, and stockpiling materials for emergency flood fighting. Risk management of Grapevine Dam is a priority for USACE at the national level which has led to higher level assessments in recent years. To understand the circumstances related to the concerns raised during a prior risk assessment, USACE conducted a more detailed analysis of the flood risks associated with the dam and incorporated the recommendations into the risk management measures discussed here.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed the construction of Mohicanville Dam in 1936. The Flood Control Act of 1939 turned over ownership, as well as operations and maintenance, of the Muskingum Basin projects to the USACE. This transition resulted in a partnership between the USACE and the MWCD wherein the USACE owns the dams and immediate land footprints, while the MWCD owns the land beneath the reservoir, stored waters and surrounding lands.\n\nMohicanville Dam is a high hazard dam located in Ashland County, Ohio, on Lake Fork of the Mohican River, approximately 11.9 miles above the mouth of Lake Fork and 171.2 miles upstream of the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio Rivers. Most dams that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages, if breached, would lead to loss of life and/or high economic impacts downstream causing them to be labeled \u201chigh hazard\u201d. The lake is a conservation pool for flood control, recreation, fish, and wildlife, and for water conservation.\nThe earthen dam has a length of 1,220 feet and a height of 46  feet and controls a drainage area of 271 square miles. The spillway is located at the left abutment and is an unregulated concrete overflow section consisting of a weir that flows onto concrete paced terraces into the outlet channel. Operation of the spillway during extreme flood events could be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping. Between 1937 and 2022, the entire Muskingum River Lake projects had prevented a total of 7.8 billion in flood damages, over $92 million of flood damages per year.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Mohicanville Dam and its associated dikes significantly reduce the risk of flooding to surrounding communities; however, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Although Mohicanville Dam have historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam and levee operate as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event.  This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillways.  In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the project\u2019s construction. \n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Mohicanville Dam and the associated Dikes in 2017  and classified the risk of failure for the dam and dikes as low.  The risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely.  During such an event, the spillways have the potential to pass over 27,260 cubic feet of water per second.  The operation of the spillway would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching. \nMohicanville Dam discharges are handled by Mohawk Dam based on the downstream control for Mohawk Dam. While the Mohicanville Dam spillway has never flowed, if operated it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities along the river corridors between Mohicanville Dam and Mohawk Dam  Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, gas, and water supply may occur.  Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along the Scioto River, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows.  \nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach high elevations quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location.  In the rare event Mohicanville Dam must pass these extreme flows, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders.  Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Mohicanville Dam. The project is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam, levee, and dikes during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting tabletop exercises and dam safety training with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Brookville Dam in 1974. Brookville Dam is located on the East Fork of the Whitewater River, 2.2 miles above its junction with the Whitewater River and roughly 0.5 miles north of Brookville, Indiana. The project is located approximately 60 air miles east of Indianapolis, Indiana, and approximately 35 miles northwest of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Brookville Lake project consists of the following structures: a 2,900 foot long earth-filled embankment with a maximum height of 181 feet, a gate controlled outlet along the base of the right abutment, and an uncontrolled, open cut spillway with an average width of 210 feet through  the right abutment. The outlet works and spillway discharge into the East Fork of the Whitewater River. At spillway crest, the reservoir extends up the East Fork of the\nWhitewater River about 18 miles. Brookville Dam reduces flooding along the East Fork of the Whitewater River and the Whitewater River to its confluence with the Ohio River. It has a drainage area of approximately 379 square miles. The record pool elevation of 766.67 ft-NAVD88 occurred in May of 2011. Dunlapsville Levee is an associated structure located approximately 11 miles north of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Brookville Lake Dam in June 2023 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 3 which is considered Moderate relative to the dams USACE owns and operates. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not eliminate the risk completely.  Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to result in unusually large quantities of water to flow through the dam spillway.  There is also a very unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is internal erosion of the dam\u2019s earthen embankment during a period of high reservoir levels leading to a breach of the dam. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along the Whitewater River. Another devastating scenario, although more unlikely, would be an overtopping event where water exceeds the capacity of the dam and flows over the embankment crest, eroding embankment material leading to a breach of the dam.  \n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream areas. The town of Brookville, IN located within a mile of the toe of the dam would be significantly impacted including essential structures such as fire stations, EMS facilities, electrical substations, school buildings, hotels, and wastewater treatment facilities. Flooding would also impact many local roadways including evacuation routes such as Highway 52. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, Brookville Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast, and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly monitors on-site instruments and conducts regular inspections to ensure the health and integrity of the dam. The frequency of these inspections increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "Bonneville Lock and Dam is located on the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon, 40 miles east of Portland, OR. The Bonneville Lock and Dam is owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and consists of a central spillway, two powerhouses, two navigation locks, four fish ladders, recreational facilities, and visitor centers. It is an iconic project within the Columbia River gorge and has evolved its operations since completion in 1938.\n\nBonneville Lock and Dam is the furthest downstream dam in a river basin the size of France (240,000 square miles). Once a river with large fluctuations in flow throughout the year, the flow is now regulated by hundreds of dams and reservoir projects upstream on the mainstem Columbia River and tributaries in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Canada. This system of dams is operated to balance many purposes, primarily the reduction of impacts from flooding during spring and summer months, and the provision of flows that support river navigation, irrigation, hydropower generation throughout the year, and fish and wildlife conservation. \n\nBonneville Lock and Dam is considered a run-of-river dam, operated to pass water and without the capacity to store large amounts of water behind the dam, compared to many larger dams further upstream. It is important to understand that while the project continues to operate reliably for its many purposes, it cannot eliminate the risk of flooding, nor can the system of dams in which it operates. \n\nThe hydropower production supported economic development and war efforts through the 1960s. Regional demand for increased hydropower production led to spillway modifications in the 1970s and construction of a second powerhouse in the 1980s. Since 1990, USACE has adjusted operations across the facility to improve passage for migratory fish. Due to its location just above sea level, Bonneville Lock and Dam is a vital link for migrating fish and inland river transportation. Learn more about the project here: https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/bonneville.\n\nBonneville Lock and Dam is located about 100 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault that parallels the Oregon Coast. This subduction zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes, the last of which occurred in 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE performs risk assessments as part of its ongoing dam safety program to understand project risk and to help prioritize future investments in infrastructure improvements. The assessments evaluate the life safety, economic, and environmental risks associated with the dam\u2019s performance to determine if and what, risk reduction actions should be taken. In 2024, USACE completed an advanced risk assessment, called an Issue Evaluation Study, that concluded that risk at Bonneville is \u201cmoderate\u201d and driven by two possible but unlikely dam safety scenarios:\n   \n1.\tAn extreme flood which overtops areas of the dam and results in uncontrolled releases. \n2.\tAn earthquake that affects the operability of the spillway or its associated components which results in overtopping areas of the dam and results in uncontrolled releases. \n\nThough unlikely, these scenarios could cause a dam breach in one or several locations, immediately or over time, resulting in uncontrolled downstream flow and potential loss of life, property damage, potential damage or overtopping of levees, economic, and environmental consequences. There is potential for the dam\u2019s structures to fail to operate in the short-term and not allow the river to flow. This could increase river elevations upstream of the dam and result in upstream impacts.\n\nUSACE now is evaluating future improvements to reduce risk to Bonneville\u2019s infrastructure should one of these scenarios arise.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE continues to conduct regular, routine inspections of its dams and Bonneville Lock and Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate potential earthquake damages. With the completion of the IES, USACE is now evaluating specific actions to reduce the two most prominent risk scenarios. \n\nUSACE will conduct dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders with responsibilities in potentially affected communities to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of Bonneville\u2019s infrastructure risks and flood risks. Bonneville Lock and Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the plan based on the results of the Issue Evaluation Study and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve the region\u2019s awareness of Bonneville\u2019s infrastructure and flood risks.",

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "Willow Island Locks and Dam are located on the Ohio River roughly 3.5 miles upstream from Waverly, WV. The project was put into operation in 1972 and has facilitated the navigation of billions of dollars\u2019 worth cargo annually. The lock portion of the project is located on the Ohio side of the river. There are two locks at Willow Island, one main lock which is 1,200 feet in length, and an auxiliary lock that is 600 feet in length. The gated dam is 1,017 feet long and is operated by eight steel tainter gates. These gates allow the pool behind the dam to be maintained at the proper level for navigation along the Ohio River. A commercial hydropower facility was completed in 2016 on the West Virginia side of the Locks and Dam. The plant includes two turbines with a total capacity of 35,000 kilowatts.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Navigation Locks and Dams such as Willow Island do not provide any protection from flooding. Willow Island Locks and Dam purpose is to manage the pool elevation upstream and to permit navigation through the river. The dam cannot perform any flood risk reduction measures. Because of this, the projected life loss from failure of the dam is zero. There would however be large economic consequences if Willow Island Locks and Dam lost pool. The loss of navigation along the Ohio would devastate local industry. The loss of pool would also cause major slippage of the riverbank along the Ohio and it\u2019s large tributaries between Willow Island Locks and Dam and Hannibal Locks and Dam upstream. This streambank erosion would cause roads and structures along the bank to be in jeopardy of slipping into the river.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Routine operations and maintenance of the project is ongoing. Although the consequences of a failure at Willow Island Locks and Dam is low, USACE still conducts regular inspections and maintenance of the structure to ensure risk remains minimal.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the Mississinewa Lake Dam in 1967 across the Mississinewa River near the town of Peru, Indiana as western most of 3 dams to reduce the risk of flooding downstream on the northern portion of the Wabash River.  The water held back by the dam forms a reservoir called Mississinewa Lake.  USACE Chicago District operates and maintains the dam.  The reservoir stores snow melt and rainfall runoff from late winter through early summer.  Periodic releases of water from the reservoir occur throughout the year to maintain seasonally specified pool levels.  Additionally, the reservoir provides recreational opportunities both in the lake and downstream.  The dam structure is primarily an earthen embankment approximately 8,000 feet long and 140 feet high at the tallest point.  Normal discharges from the dam are through a 16-foot diameter conduit near the center of the dam controlled by 3 large steel gates.  If the reservoir levels rise above elevation 779 NGVD, flow will begin to go through an unlined, uncontrolled auxiliary spillway that is approximately 1,500 feet wide.  Water from the spillway would be directed into the Wabash River approximately 3.5 miles upstream of the confluence of the Mississinewa and Wabash Rivers.  In the dam's more than 50-year history, the Mississinewa Dam has reduced downstream flood damages by more than an estimated $645 million.  USACE made major repairs to the dam from 2003 to 2006 to address settlement issues.  The pool of record at the dam occurred in July 2015 and the dam performed as intended without any problems.  The reservoir level was 1.5 feet below the sill elevation of the spillway, so no discharges were observed through the spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The Mississinewa Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, however, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  Downstream of the dam are the Cities of Peru, Logansport, Delphi, Lafayette, and Terra Haute, Indiana along with numerous other small towns and communities along the Wabash River all the way to the Ohio River.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Mississinewa Dam would be a high-volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events.  When the water level in the reservoir gets above the spillway sill, water is released to maintain the structural integrity of the dam.  The spillway bypasses flow away from the lower Mississinewa River and discharges into the Wabash River upstream of the confluence of the 2 rivers.  Numerous local roads, such as W 700 S, E 200 S (State Route 124), E 100 S, W Elliott Road, S 800 W, and E 40 N (E River Road), could become impassable in the event of discharges occurring through the spillway.  The design of the spillway is intended to release less than or no more than equal to the amount of water coming into the reservoir.  Large releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the Wabash River might behave if the dam did not exist. In addition, as the reservoir level increases, flooding will also occur upstream of the dam as the pool enlarges and extends nearly to the City of Marion, Indiana, almost 17 miles to the southeast of the dam, impacting many roads in between.\n\nA very unlikely, but far more devasting scenario that would produce significant flooding would be an extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach.  If such an event to occurs, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir and flood downstream communities.  Peoria, IN, which is located immediately below the dam, would be in immediate danger and followed by Peru, IN.  Logansport, Lafayette, and other towns and cities along the Wabash River down to the Ohio River have less awareness of the dam, but will also have more warning time to respond, should a flood occur. In the scenarios described above, the floodwaters could be swift and deep, overtopping levees, and destroying buildings and key infrastructure.  Those caught unaware and unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost could be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several steps to reduce the risk to the public.  USACE staff are continuously on-site to operate and maintain the dam.  USACE works closely with state and local emergency managers, regularly conducts emergency exercises, and routinely updates the emergency action plan (EAP) for the dam.  USACE also conducts rigorous inspection, monitoring, and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur and provide information for any necessary flood warnings.  USACE continues to work with local communities to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.",

It is located on the Otselic River in Broome County, NY, approximately one mile upstream of the confluence with the Tioughnioga River at the village of Whitney Point.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Whitney Point Lake which provides recreation benefits.  Releases are made by gates which discharge flow through a conduit in the abutment of the dam.  The project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Whitney Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to the Ostelic River.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Whitney Point, Chenango Forks, Binghamton, and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Ostelic, Tioughnioga, Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Whitney Point Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Terminus Dam in 1962. The dam is located on the Kaweah River near Lemon Cove, CA approximately 20 miles northeast of Visalia, CA. Terminus Dam reduces the risk of flooding to the cities of Lemon Cove, Visalia, Tulare, and other nearby communities by holding back water during major flood events. In addition to reducing flooding downstream, the water held back by the dam forms Lake Kaweah. Although flood risk management is the project's primary focus, the dam also provides water supply, recreation, and environmental stewardship benefits to nearby communities. The dam structure is primarily an earthen embankment with a concrete spillway located to the left of the main dam. In addition to the main dam, there is an auxiliary dam south of the marina and a dike upstream in the reservoir that protects a hotel on Sierra Drive. The auxiliary dam protects the same communities as the main dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Terminus Dam has historically performed well and significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not fully eliminate the potential for downstream flooding.  USACE completed a risk assessment for Terminus Dam in January of 2016 to understand how the dam might perform during certain scenarios and found the risk of the dam overtopping or failing in those cases to be low. Factors that do pose some concern and that might cause flooding downstream of the dam include extreme rainfall, snow melting in the Sierras, and earthquakes. A very large rainfall and snowmelt event with unusually large quantities of water could lead to larger than normal outflows of water through the dam and spillway. Even when the dam operates as intended, such a scenario could cause downstream flooding. In some scenarios, downstream levees near Tulare could be overtopped or impacted by large flows over the spillway. The most devastating potential scenario would occur if the dam were subjected to a large earthquake while the lake level was already high. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the lake, resulting in potentially deadly flooding of Visalia, CA, and other agricultural downstream communities. Another potential scenario involves water seeping through the dam and carrying soil particles away from the part of the dam that meets the natural landscape when Lake Kaweah is at a higher elevation and portions of the dam are washed away. Although these scenarios are considered extremely unlikely, Terminus Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works closely with local emergency managers, regularly updates the emergency action plan, and conducts emergency exercises with state, federal, and local partners, all of which help reduce risk to the public. USACE has full-time staff members who work at Terminus Dam. The staff performs regular maintenance and repairs as needed to keep the dam functioning properly and are available 24/7 to perform immediate inspections if an unusual event occurs.  Regular inspections and instrument monitoring ensure that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. The frequency of these checks increases when Lake Kaweah rises. USACE incorporates weather forecasts to make informed decisions on how to operate the dam. The releases at Terminus Dam are determined using the knowledge of local flows in the system and there may be situations where these localized flows change quickly and could affect the downstream communities. In most scenarios the downstream communities would have hours, or even days, from a coordinated warning notification before water reaches their homes. However, during very large and rare earthquake events, there may be little to no warning.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for London Locks and Dam in 2023 and classified the risk associated with failure as low. \n\nInundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "Warm Springs Dam is in northern California\u2019s Sonoma County.  It is on Dry Creek about 14 miles above its confluence with the Russian River and approximately 12 miles north of the City of Healdsburg.  The dam holds back water to form Lake Sonoma.  The Warm Springs Dam and Lake Sonoma project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1962 to provide flood risk management, water supply, and recreation.  Dam construction began in 1970 and was completed in 1983.  Warm Springs Dam was built  as an earth fill embankment, along with an outlet structure and concrete spillway.  The top of the dam is 3,000 feet long at an elevation 521.0 feet above sea level.  \n\nThe dam was originally built with boating, camping facilities and picnic areas.  In 1981, a visitor center, the Congressman Don Clausen Fish Hatchery and a wildlife conservation area were added to mitigate the environmental impacts of the dam.  The fish hatchery for salmon and steelhead is operated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.  In 1989, hydroelectric power generation was added by Sonoma County Water Agency.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE dams are operated and maintained following guidelines that continuously reduce risk to the public downstream.  Risk reduction measures, based on the risk assessment findings, have been implemented at Warm Springs Dam.  These include enhanced monitoring and surveillance of the dam during higher than normal pool elevations, and an emergency action plan.  Weather conditions are monitored days in advance of an approaching storm, providing a forecast of rainfall at the dam\u2019s watershed and water inflow to the dams\u2019 storage pool.  These forecasts are used to maintain the lake\u2019s pool at safe levels, preventing a spill over the dam's crest.\n  \nWarm Springs Dam is under constant monitoring by dam maintenance and operations staff, who are trained to identify dam safety concerns.  Dam Safety Engineers also regularly oversee conditions.  During storm conditions when reservoir levels are high and/or large amounts of water are being released from the dam, the staff is extra vigilant.\n\nSecond, USACE developed an emergency action plan (EAP) specifically for Warm Springs Dam and shared it with local and state emergency managers.  The EAP clarifies communication and response actions to be taken whenever conditions at the dam have the potential to affect public safety.  Coordinated implementation of the plan ensures clear, quick responses such as providing warnings and proactive evacuation orders so that those living and working can move out of harm\u2019s way.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Clendening Dam in 1937 across the Brushy Fork of Stillwater Creek in Harrison County, Ohio, 1/2 of a mile east of Tippecanoe, Ohio and 9 miles southeast of Uhrichsville, Ohio. The dam consists of an earth and rock filled embankment with a clay center, outlet works, and a spillway. The project acts as part of a 16-reservoir system of dams designed to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding within the Muskingum River Basin in southeastern Ohio. Although the project\u2019s primary purpose is to reduce flooding downstream, it is also used for recreational purposes and fish and wildlife conservation. \n\nSince Clendening Dam was constructed it has successfully helped mitigate flood damage on multiple occasions by holding back excess water from large storm events and releasing the water in a controlled fashion. Notable historical flood events in the region occurred in January 1959, February 1979, August 1980, and January 2005, in which the dam prevented significant flooding in the nearby Village of Tippecanoe, the City of Uhrichsville, and other downstream communities. Seepage immediately downstream of the dam has been prevalent at the project since construction in 1937. In effort to reduce this seepage, remedial measures were completed in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, such as grouting at each end of the dam and constructing a seepage blanket with relief wells along the downstream toe of the dam. Some seepage is still prevalent at the project; however, it has been significantly reduced.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in January 2016 and classified the risk associated with a failure of Clendening Dam as moderate. This classification is primarily based on the population at risk downstream of the dam that could be flooded in the event of large releases through the dam\u2019s spillway or in the event of a dam failure. The unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios that would produce significant flooding are: 1.) erosion of the dam's soil foundation during a period of high reservoir levels could lead to a failure of the dam and 2.) an extreme rainfall event could result in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a failure. Were either event to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. The largest impacts would be to the Village of Tippecanoe, the City of Uhrichsville, and the Village of Port Washington in Ohio where there would be little to no warning time in such an event.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk at Clendening Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Robustness of the dam is being improved with implementation of an Interim Risk Reduction Measures Plan (IRRMP) to address specific risk concerns while long-term remedial measures are pursued. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with USACE staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated in an effort to improve emergency response actions, and flood fighting materials are stored onsite in case of an emergency. The project is scheduled to undergo an Issue Evaluation Study (IES), where the risks identified for the project will be further evaluated.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Bardwell Dam in December 1954 in accordance with the Flood Control Act, approved 31 March 1960 (Public Law 86-399, 86th Congress, 2nd Session). Bardwell Dam was built on the Waxahachie Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River, to reduce the risk of flooding to the downstream Texas cities of Bardwell, Corsicana, and adjacent towns and counties. It is located 3 miles south of the City of Ennis in Ellis County, Texas. The dam consists of an earthen embankment that holds water in the reservoir, lifting gates that are operated to control water releases at the dam, and an ungated spillway, a sloped concrete structure, which allows water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir exceed the available flood storage. The main embankment is made up of soil and rock and is approximately 82 feet (about 8 stories) high at a crest elevation of 460.0 feet (NAVD88 vertical datum control). The dam is nearly three miles of earthen embankment except for the spillway located along the west end of the main embankment. The ungated spillway is 350 feet wide with an elevation of 439.0 feet NAVD88. When the reservoir water level exceeds the dedicated flood storage levels water flows over the ungated spillway by design, which can pass up to \u00bd million gallons per second, or enough water to flood a football field more than a foot deep every second. The reservoir is kept at or below the conservation pool elevation of 421.0 feet NAVD88 for most of the year. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir until the swollen streams and rivers below the dam recede and can handle the release of stored water minimizing loss of life, property, and negative impacts to the environment. Sometimes water must be released to protect the dam\u2019s integrity even though these streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity. Although reducing flood risk is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam also provides significant water supply to nearby communities and provides unique recreation opportunities. These benefits significantly improve the quality of life in the area.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Bardwell Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding due to floodwaters passed through the dam are high volume releases from the operation of Bardwell Dam through the outlet works and ungated spillway during high water events. Surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir\u2019s flood storage capacity is exceeded causing flooding in areas adjacent to the reservoir and excess water flows through the spillway and/or outlet works. Bardwell Dam (the dam, spillway, and outlet works) is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam.\n\nThe United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment in March 2016 and classified the risk associated with Bardwell Dam as low. This classification is based on both a low likelihood of poor performance and low associated consequences due to very unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios than presented above that would produce significant flooding. The potential for Bardwell Dam to fail was assessed to be related to three primary risks associated with earthen embankment dams: 1) During an extreme flood event high reservoir levels could cause water to flow over the top of the earthen dam, leading to erosion of the embankment and eventual breach; 2) Erosion along the area where the embankment fill surrounds the concrete outlet pipe leading loss of fill material and eventual breach of the dam; and 3) when the side of the earthen dam has progressing slope failures, a condition where the soil slides downhill, that could lower the crest of the dam below the elevation of the reservoir water level, leading to overflow, erosion, and eventual breach. In the remote event of a breach, the largest impacts would be to the city of Liberty, TX, which is located 346 miles downstream of the dam. Impacts are mainly commercial structures with some residential structures near the river and in the southern portion of the town. Several agricultural levees downstream of Bardwell Dam would be overtopped and will not contain floodwaters. The inundation area directly downstream of the dam is largely rural and Richland Chambers reservoir and dam begin at 28 and 47 river miles downstream, respectively. The downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure. However, while these parties meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, breach of the dam could result in major flooding downstream and include significant economic impacts and put lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes; regularly updating the Bardwell Dam Emergency Action Plan; and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and increased surveillance during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Instrumentation and monitoring systems allow USACE staff to monitor the dam for changing conditions that may not be seen at the surface. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "Summersville Dam was designed and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers who completed the construction of Summersville Dam in 1966. The project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938. Summersville Dam is located on the Gauley River, 34.5 miles upstream of the confluence of the Gauley River and the New River and 131.5 miles upstream of the mouth of the Kanawha River. It is located within the southern part of Nicholas County, West Virginia, about 5 miles southwest of Summersville, WV and 60 miles upstream from Charleston, WV, the primary consequence center. The authorized project purpose is flood control. Other authorized purposes include pollution abatement, recreation, fish and wildlife management and water supply. Summersville Dam is a rock-fill dam with a clay core that is 390 feet tall and 1,780 feet wide. The outlet works are in the right abutment of the dam and are gate controlled with a discharge capacity of approximately 19,000 cfs. The project has an uncontrolled spillway, which has the capacity to relay an additional 400,000 cfs downstream in the event of an extreme event. Additionally, two appurtenant dikes were constructed within saddles along the reservoir rim to protect adjacent population centers from raises of the Summersville Dam pool. Summersville Dam controls a drainage area of 803 square miles. Cumulative flood damages prevented are about $2 billion over the project life and average about $40.5 million annually.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Summersville Dam greatly reduces flood risks downstream; however, it does not eliminate these risks and significant flooding can still occur. There are rare storm events which cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely. While spillway flows at Summersville Dam would be very infrequent, they can result in catastrophic flooding in downstream communities along the Gauley and Kanawha Rivers including the Charleston, WV area. Critical infrastructure including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along the Gauley River, Kanawha River, and Ohio River as far downstream as Wheelersburg, OH may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows. In some rare occasions, conditions could lead to dam flows greater than 400 thousand cubic feet every second, more than four times the flow over Niagara Falls. The most impacted communities for any breach scenario and non-breach spillway flow scenario are Charleston, WV, and its surrounding area. In the scenario where the spillway was to breach, downstream flows would be expected to increase by about 50 percent. In the very unlikely event that overtopping were to occur, it would occur at the dikes before the dam is overtopped. Significant flood depths are expected from both non-breach (spillway flow) and breach conditions (failure of the dam) with life loss and economic impacts extending downstream to Charleston, WV. \n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Summersville Dam in November 2018 that characterizes the risk from breach of the dam and Dike No. 2 as moderate while risk from breach of Dike No. 1 as low. Although risks associated with a failure are moderate, there is high risk associated with the dam operating as intended due to the large spillway outflow capacity, the narrow valley terrain downstream of the dam, and the population centers along the river.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Summersville Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and teams of engineers conduct detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions. Interim risk reduction measures have been completed to survey the crest of the dams and dikes, an emergency exercise has been completed, and vegetation and trees removed from the downstream end of the spillway channel.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Pat Mayse Dam in 1967 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Pat Mayse Dam is located on Sanders Creek, a tributary of the Red River, about 10 miles north of Paris, TX. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  Water storage and releases are managed by the ungated outlet works running through the earthen embankment.  The project also includes an ungated spillway.  In addition to reducing flooding, the water held back by the dam forms a reservoir providing recreation benefits. Pat Mayse Dam is also used for water supply purposes and fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in March 2017 and classified the risk associated with Pat Mayse Dam as low.  The risk is primarily driven by the potential for water to flow over the ungated spillway causing erosion that eventually weakens the spillway.   Other issues identified include the remote potential for water to seep along the conduit resulting in embankment erosion that weakens the dam, or the potential for a flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded and water flows over the top of the dam resulting in breach.  Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream resulting in loss of life and economic impacts.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to Arthur City, TX.\nThere is also a flood risk associated with normal operation of the dam.  During large floods the capacity of the reservoir to store water could be exceeded resulting in unregulated flow through the ungated outlet works and over the auxiliary spillway and downstream flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Martis Creek Dam in 1972 as part of the Truckee River and Tributaries Project. Martis Creek Dam is located about 2 miles upstream of Truckee on Martis Creek, a tributary to the Truckee River, in Nevada County, California. Although Martis Creek Dam is located in the State of California, it reduces the frequency of flooding primarily in the Reno-Sparks Metropolitan Area in the state of Nevada, and other small communities, by holding back water during major flood events.  Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, the dam is also authorized to provide water supply, recreation, and environmental stewardship benefits. The dam structure consists of an earthfill embankment with a concrete spillway that is located to the left of the main dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Martis Creek Dam has a long history of water seeping through the dam since it was constructed. Based on its performance, many modifications were made to the dam between the years 1973-1995 to improve its performance. In 2008, USACE completed a preliminary screening of the dam to understand how it might perform during certain flood scenarios and found the risk of water seeping through the dam and carrying soil particles away from the part of the dam where the embankment meets the natural hillside and causing voids as the soil erodes, as well as overtopping of the dam to be very high. These findings led to an established maximum pool level and a requirement to always leave the gates fully open. Additional studies and risk reduction measures were implemented at the dam. In 2015, a team of engineers performed a more rigorous risk assessment and concluded that although significant quantities of water seeping through the dam have been observed at the project and are expected, it will not lead to erosion of the foundation. In addition, the largest expected flood event is significantly less frequent than originally predicted, so overtopping of the dam is less of a concern. Due to this assessment, the dam is now categorized to have moderate risk. Although overtopping and water seeping through the dam are still a concern for this dam, these scenarios are extremely unlikely. The gates remain fully open, which significantly decreases the risk to downstream communities until a test fill can be completed for Martis Creek Dam, which is currently on hold. In addition, Martis Creek Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE Sacramento district works closely with local emergency managers, regularly updates the emergency action plan, and conducts emergency exercises with state, federal, and local partners, all of which help reduce risk to the public. USACE has full-time staff members who work at Martis Creek Dam 8 months out of the year, with minimal staff during the winter season. The staff performs regular maintenance and repairs as needed to keep the dam functioning properly and are available 24/7 to perform immediate inspections if an unusual event occurs.  Regular inspections and instrument monitoring ensure that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. In most scenarios the downstream communities would have hours, or even days, from a coordinated warning notification before water reaches their homes during a flood event. However, during very large and rare earthquake events, there may be little to no warning.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began construction of Bull Shoals Dam in June 1947 and completed construction in November 1951. The USACE Little Rock District operates Bull Shoals Dam for flood risk management, municipal and industrial water supply, hydropower, irrigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife.\n\nBull Shoals Lake and Dam are major units in a comprehensive plan for the development of the water resources of the White River Basin in Missouri and Arkansas. The lake is one of a series of five lakes in the Upper White River Basin in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri. Bull Shoals Dam is located on the White River at river mile 418.6 in Marion County in north central Arkansas. The nearest communities are Bull Shoals, located approximately 1.3 miles from the dam, and Cotter, located approximately 1.8 miles downstream.\n\nThe main components of the project are a concrete dam section, which serves as the main water barrier; a concrete gated spillway, a segment of the structure used to provide additional controlled release of water from the dam during major flood events; and hydropower facilities.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Bull Shoals Dam in April 2014 that characterizes the risk of the project as moderate, which is USACE\u2019s third highest risk category. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although Bull Shoals Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction. Bull Shoals Dam has an Emergency Action Plan and Risk Reduction Plan in place to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE performs ongoing inspection, maintenance, and monitoring activities to ensure the integrity of Bull Shoals Dam and to reduce risk to downstream communities. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events. USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam. USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "Hansen Dam is located at the northern edge of the San Fernando Valley in the City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California.  The project is located on the Tujunga Wash about 1 mile downstream from the confluence of the Big Tujunga and Little Tujunga Washes as they exit the San Gabriel Mountains, and the Angeles National Forrest.  The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the dam in 1940 for the purpose of providing flood control for the lower portions of San Fernando Valley and the city of Los Angeles. Hansen Dam receives inflow from Los Angeles County\u2019s upstream Big Tujunga Dam and is operated in conjunction with the Corps\u2019 Sepulveda Dam as a part of the Los Angeles County Drainage Area (LACDA) system. The dam consists of an earthen embankment dam and saddle dike, gated and ungated outlet works, and an uncontrolled spillway. The dam is 10,475 feet long with a maximum height above streambed of 97 feet. The saddle dike is approximately 1,525 feet long and has a maximum height of approximately 22 feet. Hansen Dam typically has no pool. However, during the rainy season that normally occurs between November and early April there may be a small stream trickling through the dam. The dam contains eight operation gates which allow minor flows to pass through the project.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the Wolf Creek Dam for Flood Control in 1950 with the powerhouse being completed in August 1952.  The dam is located near Jamestown, KY on the Cumberland River approximately 460 river miles above its confluence with the Ohio River.  The project was authorized by the 1938 Flood Control Act as part of an overall plan for the Ohio River Basin and is managed by the Nashville District, USACE.  Wolf Creek Dam plays a major role in flood risk management of the Cumberland River providing protection to Burkesville, Celina, Carthage, and Nashville.  The dam has a maximum height of 258 feet, a total length of 5,796 feet, and consists of a concrete gravity section, earthen embankment, and powerhouse.  The dam routinely stores and releases water through its ten spillway gates, six hydropower turbines, and six low level sluice gates.  The spillway gates play a major role in water release during significant storm events.  Wolf Creek Dam impounds Lake Cumberland which has a total storage capacity of 6,089,000 acre-ft, making it the ninth largest reservoir by volume in the United States, and the Corps' largest east of the Mississippi River.  In addition to its originally authorized purposes of flood control and hydropower, Wolf Creek Dam and Lake Cumberland provide recreation, water supply, and water quality benefits for the basin and region.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a major investment in Wolf Creek Dam to ensure the project operates safely, including completion of a foundation grouting program, full length concrete barrier wall through the earthen embankment into the bedrock below, and supplemental underground concrete barrier wall in the switchyard to address internal erosion concerns associated with the karst rock foundation.  Following this work, the dam was assessed in 2015 for any additional concerns and the risk associated with a dam breach after remediation was rated moderate. The project risk is currently driven by the consequences of an overtopping failure of the structure as a result of Tainter gate power supply issues causing increased flows and possible flooding downstream.  Consequences from a dam failure are expected to be high with major damage centers at Burkesville, Celina, Carthage, and Nashville.  The population at risk is estimated to be over 130,000.  Additional evaluation of the Tainter gates at Wolf Creek indicate there is insufficient structural capacity to operate at design loads.  Operation of the Tainter gates in certain loading conditions could cause failure of a gate or gates, leading to increased flows and inundation of structures downstream.  There are currently no operating restrictions in place and no plans to change how water releases are managed.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase the frequency of this monitoring during lake levels rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Currently, USACE is aggressively pursuing the replacement of all ten spillway gates in order to restore full gate operability and keep the dam operating as designed.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Sardis Dam in 1982 with the primary purpose of reducing flooding in downstream communities.  Sardis Dam is located on Jackfork Creek, a tributary of the Kiamichi River, about 4 miles north of Clayton, OK. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  After the storm passes and the Kiamichi River level recedes, the water can be safety released into the river.  Water storage and releases are managed by a gated conduit running through an earthen embankment.  The project also includes an ungated auxiliary spillway.  In addition to reducing flooding, the water held back by the dam forms a reservoir providing recreation benefits. Sardis Dam is also used for water supply purposes and fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in December 2015 and classified the risk associated with Sardis Dam as moderate.  The risk is primarily driven by the potential for water seeping through the embankment which could lead to embankment erosion and breach.  Another issue identified includes the remote potential for water to seep into the conduit resulting in embankment erosion that eventually weakens the dam.  Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream resulting in loss of life and economic impacts.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the cities of Clayton and Antlers.\nDuring large floods the capacity of the reservoir to store water could be exceeded resulting in flow over the auxiliary spillway and downstream flooding.  Although this scenario would result in less flooding than a dam breach it could still result in loss of life and economic impacts due to the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Sardis Dam poses to the community.  An interim risk reduction measure plan has been implemented to reduce risk at the project.  Measures taken as a result of this plan include several repairs to the dam such as sealing leaky conduit joints, repairing drainage pipes, repairing gates, and the installation of new instrumentation to help monitor the dam performance.\nThere are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "DBreach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be very low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no estimated potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the Hartwell Dam and Lake in 1962.  The dam was built across the Savannah River on the Georgia/South Carolina border in the counties of Hart (Georgia) and Anderson (South Carolina), and 89 miles upstream of the city of Augusta, Georgia.  There were several original purposes for the construction:  flood risk reduction, hydropower production, and navigation.  The dam is operated as a system in conjunction with two other USACE dams located downstream of Hartwell Dam and upstream of Augusta:  Richard B. Russell and J. Strom Thurmond.  The system of dams aids in the reduction of downstream flooding by holding back water during major storm events.  The Hartwell Dam structure consists of a large concrete dam section with earthen embankments on either side.  A gated spillway exists within the concrete section.  The spillway contains 12 large, rotating gates called Tainter gates that can pass large volumes of water through the dam.  As the gates are raised, the dam can store more water within the reservoir which further minimizes downstream flooding.  Since construction of the dam, the spillway gates have only been opened four times due to flooding.  Altogether, Thurmond, Russell, and Hartwell dams have prevented approximately $370 million in flood damages since construction.  The Hartwell Dam hydropower plant produces an average annual output of 510,000 megawatt-hours of electrical energy.  In addition to flood risk reduction, hydropower production, and navigation, Hartwell Dam and Lake was later authorized for the following purposes:  water supply, water quality, fish and wildlife management, and recreation.  Hartwell Lake has become an extremely popular recreation location with 9.2 million visitors each year.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Hartwell Dam in June 2023.  The assessment characterizes the risk of the project as low.  The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  During large storm events, Hartwell Dam\u2019s spillway gates will be opened to keep the reservoir level below the top of the spillway gates.  Hartwell\u2019s spillway moves water from Hartwell Lake to the immediately downstream Richard B. Russell Lake.  Russell Lake can contain some of the water, but the excess will be passed by Russell\u2019s spillway to the immediately downstream J. Strom Thurmond Lake.  Just downstream of Thurmond Dam and Lake is a large population of the city of Augusta, Georgia.  Thurmond Dam is able to aid in mitigation of flooding of this downstream population by slowing down releases and allowing time for the city to begin preliminary evacuations and set Augusta Levee closures.  During an extreme storm event, an exceedingly large flow may need to be passed through Hartwell\u2019s, Russell\u2019s, and Thurmond\u2019s spillways to prevent the lakes from reaching the top of the dams.  These rare events will result in river flows that could overtop the Augusta Levee and impact widespread areas downstream of the dam with dangerous flood waters.  It should be noted that Hartwell\u2019s spillway gates have only been opened four times due to flooding, and the amount of flow passed through the dam has been minimal.  Hartwell Dam is well maintained and has historically performed well with no issues of immediate concern.  However, there is a slight chance that high lake levels may result in a breach of one of the embankments resulting in deep and swift downstream flooding.  This is an unlikely event, but one that should be considered as a possibility.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking action to prepare for emergency incidents.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  USACE engineers and project personnel perform regular inspections of the dam and evaluate the dam\u2019s instrumentation.  These inspections and instrumentation evaluations are used to assess how the dam is performing.  The frequency of the inspections and instrumentation checks increases as the Hartwell Lake pool level rises in order to detect and identify any potential dam safety issues.  Periodic training is conducted with Hartwell Dam project personnel.  This training is to help project personnel, that are at the site on a daily basis, to identify the early warning signs of a potential issue with the dam.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.   Additionally, USACE works closely with Augusta-Richmond County during flood events.  The USACE operations plan for the downstream Thurmond Dam requires a stepped spillway release during major flood events and prospective/impending dam failure events.  This allows time for Augusta-Richmond County to close gate structures within the levee and to set levee stoplog closures before the full, required spillway releases are commenced.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Hugo Dam in 1974 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities.  Hugo Dam is located on the Kiamichi River, immediately northeast of the town of Sawyer, OK, approximately 7 miles east of Hugo, OK, and 30 miles north of Paris, TX.  During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  After the storm passes and the Kiamichi River level recedes, the water can be safety released into the river.  Water storage and releases are managed by a gated concrete spillway.  In addition to reducing flooding, the water held back by the dam forms a reservoir providing recreation benefits. Hugo Dam is also used for water supply and quality purposes along with fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in  2016 and classified the risk associated with Hugo Dam as low.  The risk is primarily driven by the potential for water to seep through fractures and voids within the rock foundation resulting in erosion of the overlying embankment, as well as the potential for water to seep through the embankment resulting in erosion and breach.  Another potential identified is for water to seep through the foundation soil resulting in erosion of the foundation although this was found to be a lesser risk.  Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream resulting in loss of life and economic impacts.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the cities of Sawyer, OK, Fulton, AR, and Garland City, AR.\nA more likely flooding scenario includes a large release through the gated spillway during a flood with the project operating as intended.   Although the inundation would not be as great as a breach of the dam this scenario could still result in widespread economic impacts and loss of life due to the extent of the flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Lock & Dam 7 in 1937.  The project is located on the Mississippi River near La Crescent, Minnesota. USACE operates Lock & Dam 7 primarily for navigation purposes, but congress also authorized USACE to make recreation improvements associated with the pool formed above the dam. Additionally, environmental management on the river is coordinated with the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources, and other state & federal agencies. The main components of the project include a lock, a gated spillway structure with 5 roller gates and 11 Tainter gates, an overflow concrete weir west of French Island, the Onalaska dam that includes 4 box culverts and an overflow embankment with concrete paving, and earthen embankments connecting these other components. The entire damming surface (including the Onalaska dam) is 2.3 miles long.  The embankment sections are typically 16 feet high with a crest elevation of 648.5 feet (NAVD 88).",
    "riskCharSummary": "Lock & Dam 7 is a run-of-river dam that maintains a navigation pool for river traffic but does not store flood waters. The gated spillway is regulated to hold a constant pool level for navigation purposes at elevation 638.5 up to river flows of 90,000 cfs.  The 90,000 cfs flow has an annual chance of exceedance of about 50% each year.  Above this flow, the gates are fully opened, and the dam has less than one foot of impact on the river stages. The maximum water level differential across the dam is 8 feet and occurs at low river flows.  Based upon a risk assessment in 2018, USACE considers Lock & Dam 7 to be a low-risk dam among its more than 700 dams. Identified risks are primarily due to aging miter gates in the locks, and potential for navigation accidents. Another risk is the failure of the earth dam due to overtopping.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.   Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Other hazards exist, such as swimming and boat safety in the vicinity of the dam.  USACE regularly engages the public to raise awareness of the dam; and coordinates with state and county emergency managers (particularly during river flood events).",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Salamonie Dam in 1966 across the Salamonie River near the town of Lagro, Indiana as one of 3 dams to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the northern portion of the Wabash River.  The water held back by the dam forms a reservoir called Salamonie Lake.  USACE Chicago District operates and maintains the dam.  The reservoir stores snow melt and rainfall runoff from late winter through early summer.  Periodic releases of water from the reservoir occur throughout the year to maintain seasonally specified pool levels.  Additionally, the reservoir provides recreational opportunities both in the lake and downstream. The dam structure is primarily an earthen embankment structure approximately 6,100 feet long and 133 feet high at the tallest point.  Normal discharges from the dam are through a 16-foot diameter conduit near the center of the dam controlled by 3 large steel gates.  If the reservoir levels rise above elevation 793 NGVD, flow will begin to go through an unlined, uncontrolled auxiliary spillway to the east of the dam.  The spillway is approximately 575 feet wide and is crossed by 2 county roads.  Water from the spillway would be directed into the Wabash River approximately 2.5 miles upstream of the confluence of the Salamonie and Wabash Rivers.  In the dam's more than 50-year history, there have been no significant releases from the spillway.  The pool of record at the dam occurred in June 2015 and the dam performed as designed without any problems.  During this event, the reservoir level reached the sill elevation of the spillway with very little water flowing over.  The dam has reduced downstream flood damage by more than an estimated $531 million since it went into operation.  Upstream of the dam is a saddle dam at Lancaster, Indiana, to protect an area that would have been flooded by the reservoir during the dam's construction.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The Salamonie Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, however, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  Downstream of the dam are the Cities of Lagro, Wabash, Peru, Logansport, Delphi, Lafayette, and Terra Haute, Indiana along with numerous other small towns and communities along the Wabash River all the way to the Ohio River.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Salamonie Dam would be a high-volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events.  When the water level in the reservoir gets above the spillway sill, water is released to maintain the structural integrity of the dam.  The spillway bypasses flow away from the lower Salamonie River to discharge into the Wabash River upstream of the confluence of the 2 rivers.  Numerous local roads, such as County Road 100 S (East Salamonie Dam Road), E 50 S, and East Division Road could become impassable if water flows through the spillway.  The design of the spillway is to release less than or no more than equal to the amount of water coming into the reservoir.  Large releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the Wabash River might behave if the dam did not exist.  In addition, as the reservoir level increases, flooding will also be occurring upstream of the dam as the pool will enlarge and extend nearly to the town of Warren, Indiana, about 15 miles to the southeast of the dam.  This upstream flooding would likely impact several roads in between, including State Route 105, State Route 124, and State Route 9 (South Marion Road).\n\nA very unlikely, but far more devasting scenario that would produce significant flooding would be an extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach.  If such an event occurs, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir and flood downstream communities.  Lagro, IN is the closest community below the dam that would be in immediate danger of large damaging flood conditions, followed by Wabash, Peru, and Logansport.  The floodwaters would be swift and deep, overtopping levees, and destroying buildings and key infrastructure.  Those caught unaware and unable to evacuate could perish.  Other towns and cities along the Wabash River down to the Ohio River would also be impacted.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several steps to reduce the risk to the public.  USACE staff are continuously on-site to operate and maintain the dam.  USACE works closely with state and local emergency managers, regularly conducts emergency exercises, and routinely updates the emergency action plan (EAP) for the dam.  USACE also conducts rigorous inspection, monitoring, and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur and provide information for any necessary flood warnings.  USACE continues to work with local communities to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.",

    "projectDescription": "Big Bend Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Operating since 1964, it is the third-most downstream of six projects built on the mainstem of the upper Missouri River which, in combination with dams on the river\u2019s tributaries, reduce the risk of downstream flooding along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, this \u201cmainstem\u201d system of dams is managed to balance hydropower generation, water supply, water quality, irrigation, fish and wildlife conservation, navigation, and recreation benefits.  \n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, a powerhouse, and a gated spillway used to release excess water during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, USACE releases up to 103,000 cubic feet of water per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons) through the powerhouse to manage reservoir elevations and generate power. As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, additional releases are made using eight spillway gates to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to release up to 390,000 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release.\n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Big Bend Dam as a result of flooding was 166,300 cfs from the powerhouse and spillway in 2011. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Big Bend Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can the system of dams in which it operates). While unlikely, a non-breach release when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n\nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threats that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, are damage to the spillway during non-breach releases, inundation of the spillway gates\u2019 mechanical and electrical equipment, and erosion of the dam\u2019s foundation from water flowing beneath the embankment. Although these scenarios are very unlikely, failure of the dam or spillway would require historic water releases from the downstream Missouri River dams (Fort Randall and Gavins Point) to preserve their structural integrity. In an extreme case, water from Big Bend could exceed the storage capacities of these dams, leading to overtopping and \u201ccascading\u201d dam failures. Over the course of days to weeks, these flows would result in swift, deep, and life-threatening flooding in numerous communities (both with and without levees) along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities).\n\nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Big Bend Dam as \u201cmoderate\u201d among its more than 700 dams due to the potential loss of life and large, national-scale consequences should a breach occur. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure. Please note that some scenarios in this database for the six USACE dams on the upper Missouri River do not depict the full extent of downstream inundation including the extent of \u201ccascading\u201d inundation that could develop from upstream Missouri River dam failure(s). For more information on the USACE Dam Safety Program and risk assessments, visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Ongoing Actions:  The USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks. For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.\n\t\nActions at Big Bend Dam: While USACE continues to evaluate how to further reduce the risks associated with Big Bend Dam, several risk reduction measures have been completed following significant flooding in 2011, including additional instrumentation to enhance foundation monitoring and upgrades to key foundation drainage systems (as well as installation of additional drains) to prevent water from eroding the dam\u2019s foundation. Numerous repairs also were  made to the spillway to improve its resiliency during future flood events.\n \nBuilding Awareness:  Since dams do not eliminate flood risk, communities downstream of USACE\u2019s Missouri River dams are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to their family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Benbrook Dam in February 1951. The structure is located on the Clear Fork, a tributary of the West Fork of the Trinity River, approximately 17 miles southwest of the City of Fort Worth in Tarrant County, Texas. Benbrook Lake is a multi-purpose reservoir designed for flood risk management (FRM), water supply, recreation, and environmental benefits. It is a unit of the Trinity River Basin System, which consists of eight USACE lakes and various channel improvements and levees operated to reduce the risk of downstream flooding along the Trinity River. The dam is an earthen embankment, approximately 1.7 miles long and consists of the following three components: a 130-foot-tall main embankment used to retain the water for the lake; an outlet works, which includes lifting gates and a pipe through the dam, used to regulate water releases and water storage; and an ungated spillway, which allows water to flow out when lake levels exceed the available flood storage. The ungated spillway is a safety measure to prevent the lake levels from overflowing the top of the dam in extreme flood events. It is also important because it directs how and where water is released. The reservoir is kept at or below the conservation pool elevation for most of the year. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir until the swollen streams and rivers below the dam recede and can handle the release of stored water minimizing loss of life, property, and negative impacts to the environment. Sometimes water must be released to protect the dam\u2019s integrity even though these streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Benbrook Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding due to floodwaters passed through the dam is high volume releases from Benbrook Dam through the outlet works and ungated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Benbrook Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. Despite the flood reduction benefits of the dam provides, very rare, severe storms could still produce high surcharge releases with the potential to exceed the capacity of the downstream channels and impact the communities of Benbrook, Fort Worth, Arlington, Irving, and Dallas, putting thousands of people at risk.\n\nIn February 2020, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment to evaluate the dam\u2019s potential hazards, expected performance, and associated consequences. The risk assessment classified risks associated with Benbrook Dam as moderate. This classification is based on the potential for high life loss and consequences due to unlikely, but a far more devastating scenario than presented above, that would produce significant flooding. Risk for Benbrook Dam is driven by an extremely unlikely flood event, unlike anything ever experienced in the area, resulting in water flowing over the top of the dam, potentially leading to erosion of the embankment and an eventual dam breach. In the remote event of a dam breach, downstream flood waters would be deep and would move swiftly through cities located along the Clear and West Forks of the Trinity River through Tarrant and Dallas Counties, including downtown Fort Worth and downtown Dallas. This flooding due to dam breach could overflow levees and cause catastrophic damage to buildings and critical infrastructure. Flooded river depths immediately downstream of the dam could exceed the height of a four-story building. Additionally, there would be flood impacts experienced along the Trinity River all the way to the Gulf of America. Also, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. Although the large downstream communities have thorough, well-practiced emergency action plans; local emergency managers who meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events; and local emergency managers who are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, if a breach of the dam were to occur, it would result in severe economic damages and thousands of people\u2019s lives would be at risk within the inundated area.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes. The Emergency Action Plan is updated and exercised annually, improving emergency response and coordination between USACE elements and downstream federal, state, county, city agencies, and stakeholders. USACE also communicates risks associated with Benbrook Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers. Inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam, and surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. The performance of Benbrook Dam is monitored by an instrumentation system, allowing USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as conducting regular surveillance of the dam, assessing the current instrumentation program, providing needed maintenance and repairs such as filling the low spots in the crest, and stockpiling materials for emergency flood fighting. Risk management of Grapevine Dam is a priority for USACE at the national level which has led to higher level assessments in recent years. To understand the circumstances related to the concerns raised during a prior risk assessment, USACE conducted a more detailed analysis of the flood risks associated with the dam and incorporated the recommendations into the risk management measures discussed here.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Foster Joseph Sayers Dam in 1969 to reduce the risk of flooding to downstream communities by storing water during major flood events.  It is located on Bald Eagle Creek in Centre County, PA, approximately one mile upstream of Blanchard, PA and fourteen miles upstream of the confluence with the West Branch Susquehanna River at Lock Haven, PA.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that creates Foster Joseph Sayers Lake which provides water quality and recreation benefits.  Releases are made by gates which discharge flow through a conduit beneath the dam.  The project also includes an ungated spillway which can release large flows during significant flood events.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Foster Joseph Sayers Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, it does not eliminate the risk of flooding.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillway releases water to Bald Eagle Creek.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the dam could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Blanchard, Mill Hall, Flemington, Lock Haven and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Bald Eagle Creek and West Branch Susquehanna River would also be impacted.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Foster Joseph Sayers Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Belleville Locks and Dam in 2022 and classified the risk associated with failure as low. \n\nInundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Skiatook Dam in 1985 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities. The dam consists of an earthen embankment, a concrete gate tower with an outlet tunnel, and an ungated spillway. Skiatook Dam is located on Hominy Creek about 5 miles west of Skiatook, OK on Hominy Creek, a tributary to the Verdigris River. During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  This stored water can then be released in a more controlled manner to reduce dangerous flooding.  These releases are regulated by a discharge tunnel through the earthen dam. For larger flood events, the ungated spillway allows additional releases to help prevent dam overtopping. Skiatook Dam also provides local benefits including water supply, water quality monitoring, fish and wildlife habitats, and recreation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Skiatook Dam in 2023 and classified the risk associated with the dam as moderate.  The risk is primarily driven by the potential for water overtopping the embankment.  Another potential failure mode identified is the potential for water seeping through the embankment leading to erosion and failure.  Failure of the dam would include catastrophic flooding downstream and widespread economic impacts and loss of life.  In the remote event of a dam failure, the largest impacts would be to the cities of Skiatook, Sperry, Claremore, Owasso, Tulsa, and other communities along the Arkansas River.  Key infrastructure from Avant to Webbers Falls could also be damaged or destroyed.\n\nA more likely flooding scenario includes a large release through the ungated spillway during a flood with the project operating as intended.  Although the inundation would not be as great as a breach of the dam this scenario could still result in widespread economic impacts and loss of life due to the extent of the flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk that Skiatook Dam poses to downstream communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. These instruments are monitored regularly for any early indications of potential safety concerns at the project.",

The main components of the project are an embankment dam, outlet works with two gated conduits, a controlled spillway, and the Blue Rapids levee located upstream. The Blue Rapids Levee was constructed as part of the dam construction project for Tuttle Creek. The primary consequence center is Manhattan, Kansas, approximately 5 miles downstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Tuttle Creek Dam is currently categorized as moderate risk (Dam Safety Action Classification 3) based on the 2020 risk assessment.   The risk driving potential failure modes for the 2020 risk assessment were: 1) overtopping of the main embankment dam during an extreme flood event; 2) spillway headcut erosion initiating at the unlined spillway; and 3) spillway headcut erosion initiating at the chute slabs.  There is a significant risk of downstream flooding during a spillway release with the dam functioning properly.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high reservoir levels. Rainfall forecasts and reservoir levels are routinely monitored and if a high reservoir level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be very low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no estimated potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Youghiogheny Dam in 1943 across the Youghiogheny River to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Youghiogheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers, including metropolitan Pittsburgh. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $600 million. The reservoir also serves to store rainfall from late winter through early summer to augment flow during the drier late summer and early autumn months, provide water supply to downstream communities, and can be used for recreational purposes.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Youghiogheny Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most recent risk assessment was completed in 2020, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as moderate. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Youghiogheny Dam would be an uncontrolled high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during significant storm events. The spillway is a concrete chute that automatically releases water to the Youghiogheny river downstream of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high to reduce the likelihood that water from the reservoir could overtop and erode the earthen dam. Water released from the spillway would cause flooding in downstream communities and create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam did not exist.\n\nThere are two much less likely, but far more devastating scenarios that would produce significant flooding: 1. erosion of the dam's soil foundation during a period of high reservoir levels could lead to a breach of the dam and 2. an extreme rainfall event could result in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach. If either of these events were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Confluence, Ursina and adjacent communities located in the valley below the dam are in more immediate danger in the event of a flood. Towns and cities further downstream, including Ohiopyle, Connellsville, West Newton, and Pittsburgh have larger populations and less awareness of the dam, but will also have greater warning times, should a flood occur.\n \nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, we will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plan. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. We are working with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with local residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Inundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.  More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "Burnsville Dam is a dam built in 1976 by the US Army Corps of Engineers and is located about 2.5 miles from I-79 in Braxton County, WV, about 3 miles upstream of the Town of Burnsville. It creates Burnsville Lake which is fed by the Little Kanawha River. The Little Kanawha generally flows West-Northwest and empties into the Ohio River in Parkersburg, WV. USACE operates the Burnsville Dam for flood damage reduction, water quality control, fish and wildlife habitat, and recreation. The main components of the dam are a concrete gravity section flanked by right and left earthen embankment sections. Within the concrete gravity structure sluice gates and a gated spillway exist which are used to provide releases of water from the dam. The earthen and concrete dam is 1,400 feet long with a top width of 24 feet.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Burnsville Dam has always performed well, providing flood risk reduction to the downstream communities. However, dams reduce but do not eliminate the risk of economic and environmental damages and loss of life from flood events. When a flood exceeds the reservoir's capacity, large amounts of water may have to be released that could cause damaging flooding downstream. A fully functioning dam could be overtopped when a rare, large flood occurs, or a dam could breach because of a deficiency, both of which pose risk of property damage and life loss. Based upon the most recent risk assessment of Burnsville Dam in 2016, USACE considers this dam to be a moderate to high-risk dam among its more than 700 dams nationwide primarily due to potential for overturning of spillway monoliths and internal erosion during rare high flood events. The major areas at risk in the event of a dam breach or failure would be Burnsville, Glenville, Grantsville, and Parkersburg. In the event of this large, rare flood causing a dam breach, the water would pose risk to an estimated 4,500 people, 2,100 structures, and $396.7 million dollars\u2019 worth of land and property. In the event of a rare flood event with no dam breach, an estimated 3,600 people and $299.1 million dollars\u2019 worth of property could be at risk. There will always be flood risk that has to be managed. To manage these risks USACE has a routine program that inspects and monitors its dams regularly. USACE has also implemented interim risk reduction measures and/or long-term risk reduction measures to reduce this risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Burnsville Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Robustness of the dam is being improved with implementation of an Interim Risk Reduction Measures Plan (IRRMP) to address specific risk concerns while long-term remedial measures are pursued. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with USACE staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Tionesta Dam from 1938 through 1941 across Tionesta Creek, which created Tionesta Lake.  The primary purpose of Tionesta Dam is to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on Tionesta Creek and the Allegheny River, including the towns of Tionesta, Oil City, and Franklin Pennsylvania.  Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $630 million.  The reservoir also serves to enhance fish and wildlife and for recreation.  The dam is composed of an earthen embankment that is 184 feet high and about 1,000 feet long.  The reservoir levels are managed to approved levels throughout the year, normally by means of releases through a concrete tunnel that discharges water downstream to Tionesta Creek.  To reduce the possibility that the reservoir will overtop the dam, there is an uncontrolled spillway beyond the embankment.  In order to reduce the possibility that the reservoir will overtop the dam, a spillway (a concrete chute) was constructed beyond the right side of the dam to release a large volume of reservoir water away from the dam during significant rainfall events to reduce the possibility that water from the reservoir will overtop the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment was completed in 2018, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as very low.  The most likely flooding scenario is that high reservoir levels would result in flow through the spillway. The frequency and amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities with conditions similar to how the creek might behave if the dam did not exist. A less likely, but far more devastating flooding scenario exists:  during an extreme rainfall event, high water levels in the reservoir could cause high water pressure within the embankment dam or its foundation. If this were to occur, the high-pressure water could erode the soils in the dam, which could lead to a breach of the dam. .  \nIn either scenario, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Tionesta Pennsylvania, located in the valley downstream of the dam, is in immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Towns and cities further downstream, such as Oil City, Franklin, and Kittanning, Pennsylvania, have larger populations and less awareness of the dam, but will also have greater warning times, should a flood occur.  In the event of breach, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, we will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plan. We will also continue our rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. We work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with local residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Millwood Dam in June of 2022 that characterizes the risks associated with the project as low. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although Millwood Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when USACE operates the dam as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction. A less likely scenario would be if one of the gates were to have a problem during operation. In this case, more water than intended could be released, but that additional discharge would be limited to the amount that could pass through one gate. The most devastating potential scenario, but significantly less likely to happen, would occur if the dam were subjected to an extreme rainfall event that exceeded the damming surface. In this highly unlikely event, an uncontrolled release of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding of Fulton, Arkansas and the Shreveport-Bossier City Metropolitan area, Coushatta, Louisiana and other downstream communities. Millwood Dam has an Emergency Action Plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE performs ongoing inspection, maintenance, and monitoring activities to ensure the integrity of Millwood Dam and to reduce risk to downstream communities. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events. USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam. USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built North San Gabriel Dam on the North Fork of the San Gabriel River in the mid-to-late 70's to reduce the risk of flooding to the downstream  city of Georgetown and adjacent towns and counties. Although flood risk management is the project's primary focus, the authorized project purposes include water supply, water quality control, irrigation, recreation and fish and wildlife conservation. These benefits all significantly improve the quality of life in the area. North San Gabriel Dam is located 3.5 miles west of Georgetown, Texas.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment that holds water in the reservoir, gates that are operated to control water releases at the dam, and a spillway, which allows water to flow out when water levels within the reservoir become high. The main dam is made up of soil and rock and is 162 feet (just over 16 stories) high near its center at a crest elevation of 861.3 feet (NAVD88 vertical datum control).  The embankment is slightly over one mile long starting at about Lake Overlook Road and the Project Office on the north end to the 1000-foot long spillway towards the southwest.  Rockfill dikes 40-50 feet high are located along the downstream side of the dam for spillway release embankment erosion protection during uncontrolled spillway releases during rare flooding events. The reservoir is kept at or below the conservation pool elevation of 791.3 feet NAVD88 for most of the year. When heavy rains occur, surface water runoff is stored in the reservoir until the swollen streams and rivers below the dam recede and can handle the release of stored water without damage to lives, property or the environment. Sometimes water must be released to protect the dam's integrity even though these streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Even though North San Gabriel Dam reduces the risk of flooding to the downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from North San Gabriel Dam are high volume releases through the uncontrolled overflow spillway during significant storm events. Such higher surcharge releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist. Although North San Gabriel Dam has historically performed well and safely passed the 1992 flood event with 2\u2010feet of water through the spillway, extreme rainfall events may result in up to 27\u2010feet of water over the spillway. A spillway event of this magnitude would impact critical infrastructure downstream and has the potential to result in loss of life in Georgetown, Texas, and surrounding downstream communities. USACE Fort Worth District completed a risk assessment for North San Gabriel Dam in May 2016 and classified the risk associated with North San Gabriel Dam as moderate. This risk classification is primarily driven by the very low probability for dam failure and the large population at risk living downstream of the dam. The potential for breach of North San Gabriel Dam was assessed to be related to two primary risks associated with earthen embankment dams: 1) Overtopping of the main dam or closure dikes during an extreme flood event leading to erosion and eventual breach of the dam, or 2) potential for breach of the dam at reservoir levels leading up to the top of the dam due to water passing through the dam embankment and foundation into internal drains or into solution cavities in the limestone foundation. In the remote event of a dam breach the largest impacts would be to the city of Georgetown and adjacent downstream areas. Should such a breach occur, significant flooding greater than 15 feet deep would be experienced down the San Gabriel River to at least Granger Dam located downstream. Although these communities have emergency action plans and local emergency managers meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events, including the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes; regularly updating the North San Gabriel Dam Emergency Action Plan; conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams; and annually communicating risks associated with North San Gabriel Dam with stakeholders and Emergency Managers. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures, such as removing and maintaining vegetation growth along the toes of the dam; maintaining road surfaces on the dam to provide some erosion resistance should water flow over the dam; and is planning to stockpile emergency materials on site to lessen the impacts associated with unexpected poor performance or overtopping. USACE Fort Worth District regularly inspects and monitors instruments that help ensure that the structure is performing as intended and to help detect potential concerns. The frequency of dam inspections increases when the lake level rises. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed on project features as needed to keep the dam properly functioning.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Maxwell Locks and Dam across the Monongahela River in 1965.  The dam is located about 3.5 miles southwest of Brownsville, Pennsylvania and about 61 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Grays Landing Lock and Dam, which is located near Masontown, Pennsylvania. The dam is concrete and has five steel gates.  The locks provide a lift of nearly 20 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The locks allow river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The locks consist of two adjacent rectangular chambers that are 84 feet wide by 720 feet long and are formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The pool created by the dam also provides water supply to five municipal and industrial intakes and provides recreational opportunities for the region. The economic benefit of shipping materials and goods through the lock, water supply, and recreation is more than 83 million dollars annually.  The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2021, which characterized the risk as very low. The assessment identified one primary scenario that could cause the dam to fail.  During times of high river levels, barges in the upper pool could break loose and become trapped on the dam which could prevent one or more dam gates from closing.  This could result in a loss of the upper pool such that the river level becomes too low to allow river traffic to continue.  If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequence would be the loss of shipping and water supply, which would damage the regional economy by more than 136 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping, water supply, and boat recreation.  Although three barge incidents have occurred at the dam in the past, the loss of pool has been less than two weeks in duration.  Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations.  We regularly update our emergency action plan. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Emmett Sanders Lock and Dam in April 2022 that characterizes the risks associated with the project as low because there is no potential for life loss or significant economic damages in the unlikely event the lock and dam fail. \nThe dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not eliminate the risk. The initial Screening Portfolio Risk Assessment (SPRA) identified overtopping erosion leading to loss of pool and instability of a dam pier due to a seismic event as the risk driving failure modes and recommended Sanders Lock and Dam be categorized a DSAC 4. The 2022 risk assessment identified backwards erosion piping of the left embankment and liquefaction of dam foundation to be the primary risk drivers. A loss of service risk driver, allision with a miter gate, was also identified. No other failure modes were believed to have sufficient risk to contribute to the project total risk. Overtopping of the left embankment identified as a risk driver during the SPRA was excluded as a risk driver due to the embankment core being constructed of erosion resistant materials and continued performance during frequent overtopping events.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Dam safety training of project operation and maintenance for personnel was conducted in July 2019. The Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is maintained and regularly updated. The EAP was last updated in March 2022. An orientation seminar and drill were conducted in April 2022. Participants included staff with the Little Rock District Emergency Management office, McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, and local Office of Emergency Management. Since the project is currently categorized as DSAC 4, an Interim Risk-Reduction Measures Plan (IRRMP) is not required. Routine dam safety activities and normal operations, maintenance, monitoring, and evaluation are considered appropriate.",

    "projectDescription": "Orwell Dam is located about 7 miles southwest of Fergus Falls, Minnesota, in Ottertail County and on the Ottertail River. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed Orwell Dam, completed in 1953.  The original purposes were flood control, water supply, and water quality (pollution abatement was primarily due to beet processing during low flow periods).   The water supply and pollution abatement are no longer significant after technological changes, but they remain as secondary purposes.  The conservation pool is maintained for fish & wildlife and recreation.  Flood control is maximized by reservoir drawn down in early spring to provide storage for anticipated snowmelt runoff. The main components of the project are an earthen embankment, a combined gated spillway and outlet structure, and a downstream tailwater control structure.  The earthen dam is 1,355 feet long and 47 feet high, and the elevation of the top of the earthen embankment is 1080 feet NAVD88. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. (A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream.)",
    "riskCharSummary": "Orwell dam has provided an average of $1.4 million annually in flood damage reduction benefits since it was placed into service, but it does not eliminate flood risk in the Ottertail River.   Flood events may occur throughout the year, particularly during spring snowmelt and summer storms.  Orwell is designed for extreme events where water must be released to protect the dam\u2019s integrity even though streams and rivers may have already reached or exceeded their capacity. The gated spillway is sized to discharge 24,000 cubic feet per second, which matches peak inflows during the probable maximum flood. Since the dam was constructed, the maximum outflows have been less than 2000 cubic feet per second. \n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment for Orwell Dam in 2020 that characterized the risk associated with the project as Low. Failure scenarios considered hydrologic adequacy, embankment overtopping due to inoperability of the spillway gate, and seepage in the spillway foundation.   Life safety consequences derived from inundation mapping are mostly in Breckenridge and Wahpeton, both about 30 miles downstream.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE is continually taking steps to manage the risks to the public.  Weather and streamflow forecast information is critical for operating the dam most effectively.  The Corps of Engineers works closely with the National Weather Service to share real-time data and river models; and this information is used to minimize any flooding impacts to downstream communities.   To manage dam safety risks, USACE has a routine program that inspects and monitors its dams regularly and implements short- and long-term actions on a prioritized basis when unacceptable risks are found at any of its dams. To meet safety standards for extreme floods, a parapet wall was added to the embankment and the tailwater control structure was added about 1000 feet downstream of the dam in 2001.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Hords Creek Dam in June 1948. Initial phase of construction is contained in the Flood Control Act, approved 18 August 1941 (Public Law 228, Seventy-seventh Congress, First Session) and completion of Hords Creek Reservoir was authorized by the Flood Control Act, approved 22 December 1944 (Public Law 534, Seventy-eighth Congress, Second Session). It is located approximately 9 miles west of the City of Coleman in Coleman County, Texas. The dam reduces the risk of downstream flooding along Hords Creek by holding back waters during heavy rain events. The dam is an earthen dam, approximately 1.19 miles long, with an un-gated spillway on the western end and a gated concrete conduit in the middle with an un-gated opening on the upstream side. The spillway on the western end holds water to 19-feet below the top of the dam; however, there are no gates to regulate water flows when the reservoir rises above that level. Any water above that level will flow downstream. The gated concrete conduit, or pipe through the dam, is used for releasing water in a regulated manner during and after flood events. The conduit is not used during periods of drought. The un-gated opening on the upstream side of the concrete conduit holds water to 39-feet below the top of the dam; however, there are no gates to regulate water flows when the reservoir rises above that level. Additional benefits of the dam are water supply, recreation, and fish and wildlife conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Hords Creek Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Hords Creek Dam was designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment in July 2018 and classified the risk associated with the project as very low. This classification is based on an extremely unlikely flood event which could cause water to seep through the embankment along the concrete conduit or through fractures in the limestone at the right abutment of the concrete conduit. In the remote event of a dam breach, the largest impacts would be to the City of Coleman, Texas located approximately 14 miles below the dam. In any of these unlikely scenarios, downstream flooding in Coleman, Texas would occur within 2 hours of breach and could be as deep as a two-story structure, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Hords Creek Dam through the un-gated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Surcharge releases through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put hundreds of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a one-story building. Although the large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans, and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "In order to lower the risks associated with the dam, inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam. Surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Routine maintenance and dam safety monitoring are performed to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. The downstream embankment was repaired in 2019 after a slide caused damage to the embankment, slope protection, and crest road. Additionally, Hords Creek Dam is well maintained with an instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. A new measuring weir was installed in 2019 to monitor the amount of water seeping through the dam. The Emergency Action Plan is updated and exercised annually, improving emergency response and coordination between USACE elements and downstream federal, state, county, city agencies, and stakeholders. USACE also communicates risks associated with Hords Creek Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Pomme De Terre Dam, completing in 1961. Pomme De Terre Dam is located on the Pomme De Terre River, two miles south of Hermitage. It is the only dam along the Pomme de Terre River before it enters the Osage River as an arm of Truman Lake. Downstream of the dam is the community of Hermitage, Missouri and the Harry S. Truman Reservoir. The dam was authorized for flood control, water quality, recreation, fish & wildlife enhancement. Additional authorized purposes include navigation and water supply, but the lake is not regulated for these purposes. Pomme De Terre Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $144 million (2021 price level) from 1961 to 2021. The dam is 4,630 feet long composed of rolled earth and rock fill. The top of the dam sits approximately 155 feet above the stream.  Additionally, the Pomme De Terre Lake project contains a dike next to the left abutment to complete the reservoir rim.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE is confident that the dam is solidly built, well maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks. However, the dam alone cannot eliminate all flooding. Extreme rainfall events that exceed Pomme De Terre\u2019s storage capacity causing the release of water down the uncontrolled spillway, even if the river at or beyond capacity to prevent overtopping and failure of dam. This can result in flooding at downstream areas or can worsen already existing flooding downstream due to the rivers being over capacity. \n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment for Pomme De Terre Dam in May 2022 to determine the ability of USACE to meet the flood risk management goals of the dam. As a result, the risk due to dam breach is characterized as low. In an extreme flood scenario, inflows into the lake may exceed the storage and release capacity of the dam, and overtopping may occur. If overtopping occurs the earthen embankment of dam could erode leading to a sudden release of water downstream. This would result in extreme flooding in Hermitage, Missouri and high levels in Harry S. Truman Lake.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our collective emergency action plans. We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently when heavy rainfall causes high lake levels. Rainfall forecasts and lake levels are routinely monitored and if a high lake level is forecasted, we will promptly inform local and state emergency managers so that they can take protective actions, make flood warnings, and prepare for emergency responses. We will work with communities that are developing downstream of the dam to help them understand how they can better prepare for a potential flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Buffumville Dam in 2015 and has classified the risks associated with the dam as Low. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Buffumville Dam would be an uncontrolled high volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events. The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave during a flood event if the dam did not exist. \n\nThere is also an extremely unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would result in failure of the dam or dike and downstream flooding: water seeping through the dam earth embankments results in voids in these structures as the soil erodes, potentially weakening the structures. This erosion could occur in the upper portion of the foundation soil, through the cutoff trench in the original river channel, or in the cutoff trench/bedrock interface and could lead to a breach  Were any of these events to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Oxford, Webster ,and Dudley, MA are the major areas in immediate danger in the event of the flood. Towns and cities further downstream in Massachusetts and Connecticut would also be impacted, but less so. \n\nEven though very unlikely, if any of the scenarios described above were to occur, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater than flooding due to spillway discharges.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.\n\nBuffumville Dam is operated in conjunction with Hodges Village Dam and is staffed daily.  During set pool elevations, the dam is inspected daily by project staff.  If the pool rises higher, engineers inspect the site as well.  Instrumentation is monitored monthly at a minimum, and daily during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built Loyalhanna Dam in 1942 across the Loyalhanna Creek to hold water back during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding on the Kiskiminetas, Allegheny and Ohio Rivers including metropolitan Pittsburgh. The dam is located on Loyalhanna Creek in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, approximately 5 miles upstream of Saltsburg and forms the Loyalhanna Creek Reservoir.  Loyalhanna Dam has a maximum height of 120 feet.  The dam is composed of a concrete gravity section that is 760 feet long, and an adjoining embankment section which extends the dam toward the left abutment, giving the dam a total length of 960 feet. The concrete portion of the dam contains five steel gates near the dam\u2019s crest.  When the reservoir level rises to unusually high levels, these gates are opened to release water to the Kiskiminetas River to reduce the likelihood that the reservoir will overtop the dam.  The reservoir stores rainfall to maintain downstream flow within the downstream river banks and releases water after flood events and provides numerous opportunities for recreation. Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damage caused by downstream flooding by more than an estimated $650 million.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Loyalhanna Dam was completed in 2015, which characterized the risk as low.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Loyalhanna Dam would be a high-volume release of water from the dam\u2019s spillway during an unusually large and intense rainfall  event. The frequency and amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities. Such higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam had not been constructed.\n  \nThere are three other less likely, but far more devastating scenarios that could occur during periods of extreme and prolonged rainfall events: 1. If the reservoir level rises above the top of the embankment portion of the dam, overflowing water could erode the embankment, leading to a breach. 2. High reservoir levels could cause high water pressure in the foundation of the dam, where the concrete dam meets the embankment dam; the high-pressure water could erode the embankment dam, leading to a breach. 3. If the reservoir level rises above the top of the dam, there is a possibility that a portion of the concrete dam could slide downstream, resulting in a breach. \n\nWith any of these scenarios, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities. Saltsburg and adjacent communities, located in the valley below the dam, are in more immediate danger in the event of a flood. Towns and cities further downstream, including Avonmore, Vandergrift and Pittsburgh have larger populations and less awareness of the dam, but will also have greater warning times, should a flood occur.\n\nIn any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish. In the less likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, we will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conducting emergency exercises, and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plan. We will \ncontinue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently during high water events. We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings. We work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with local residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current lake levels at Loyalhanna Creek Lake is available to the public via the internet at:\n\nhttps://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/03046500/#dataTypeId=continuous-62615-0&period=P7D&showMedian=true",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Nolin River Dam in 1963. Nolin River Lake is located in south-central Kentucky, approximately 9 miles north of Brownsville, Kentucky, and 12 miles south of Leitchfield, Kentucky. The project consists of a 980-foot-long earth and rock fill embankment with a maximum height of 166 feet, a gate-controlled outlet works along the base of the right abutment, and a 300-foot wide, uncontrolled open-cut spillway through the right abutment. The project manages the flood risk along approximately 8 miles of the Nolin River, approximately 184 miles on the Green River, and to a lesser extent on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The project has a drainage area of approximately 703 square miles. At spillway crest, the reservoir extends up the Nolin River approximately 58 miles. The record pool\noccurred in May 2011 where the pool elevation reached 559.3 ft-NAVD88, which is 0.3 feet below the spillway sill elevation of 559.6 ft-NAVD88.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Nolin River Dam in May 2019 that characterizes the risk of the project as a Dam Safety Action Classification (DSAC) 3 which is considered Moderate relative to the dams the USACE owns and operates. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not eliminate the risk completely. Although the Nolin River Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam spillway. There is also an unlikely, but far more devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding, which is internal erosion of the dam's earthen embankment during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach of the dam. Another unlikely devastating scenario that would produce significant flooding would be spillway erosion due to a prolonged period of flow through the spillway from high reservoir levels. In both of these scenarios, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir,\nresulting in potentially deadly flooding along the Nolin and Green Rivers.\n\nIf a dam failure occurred, water from the reservoir would flood downstream communities. The largest impacts would be to the communities of Brownsville, Woodbury, and Morgantown along the Green River. Smaller communities in portions of Edmondson, Butler, and Warren counties along the Nolin and Green, as well as the Barren River due to backwater effects, would also be impacted. The communities of Rochester and Livermore further downstream along the Green River would be impacted but to a lesser extent due to attenuation of flood depths.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE utilizes the latest forecast, and stream gauge information and coordinates closely with the National Weather service concerning conditions both upstream and downstream of the dam including inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Rainfall forecasts are used to determine when high pool events may occur. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Flood fighting materials are stockpiled at the project and readily available for use during emergency conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Allegheny River Lock and Dam 9 across the Allegheny River in 1938.  The dam is located in Armstrong County, near the Town of Rimer, Pennsylvania, about 62 miles upstream of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to East Brady, Pennsylvania, which is located approximately 9.8 miles upstream. The dam consists of a concrete spillway section, which means that the river flows freely over it.  The lock provides a lift of about 22 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock consists of a rectangular chamber that is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long and formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  A privately-operated hydropower plant is located in line with the dam near the right bank.  Intakes for water supply to nearby communities are situated in the upper pool.  The upper pool also provides recreation opportunities for surrounding communities.  The dam provides about 3 million dollars in economic benefits to the region each year.  There are no means of controlling the flow over the dam and the dam does not provide the nearby communities any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2021, which characterized the risk as very low, because there is no potential for life loss or significant economic damages in the unlikely event that the dam fails. If the upper pool of the dam is released due to a dam failure, the consequences would be the loss of river traffic, water supply, recreation, and hydropower generation, which would damage the regional economy by about 3 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored. Although this scenario is possible, the dam has performed well for over 80 years without incident.  Due to the relatively short height of the dam, which lies entirely within the banks of the Allegheny River, downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communication and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam or that may adversely affect economic benefits.  We regularly update our emergency action plan. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. \n\nAlthough Blackwater Dam educes the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Blackwater Dam is designed to manage peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Blackwater Dam through the ungated spillway during high water events. This type of water release occurs when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Water moving through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a four-story building. While weather can be unpredictable, this type of event can often be predicted 1-2 days before flood waters would impact downstream communities. USACE will engage state emergency managers when such an event is forecasted and support actions to get people to safety.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment in 2018 and classified the risks associated with the Blackwater Dam as low. This classification is based on the large population that lives immediately downstream of the dam in Webster and Contoocook, NH, as well as smaller communities along the Merrimack River. Two unlikely, but devastating scenarios that would produce significant downstream flooding are breach of the dam due to water flowing over the top of the dam or embankment erosion leading to breach. In the case of an extremely rare and large rain event, water could potentially flow over the top of the dam, which could cause erosion of the earthen embankment, and breach of the dam. In addition, internal erosion of the embankment could create a flow path through the dam, which could eventually allow the crest to collapse.  In these scenarios,  Webster and Contoocook, along with smaller communities along the river, would be the most impacted.  Downstream flooding in Webster would occur less than an hour after of breach and the rapidly moving water could be as deep as 31 feet, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. The estimated potential incremental life loss associated with a failure of the dam is up to 52 people. \n\nThe risk of failure of the two dikes is also considered to be low.  It is driven by the possibility of leaking through the embankment leading to internal erosion, then breach.  The area likely to be impacted by dike failure is the valley between the dikes and Contoocook, NH.  The estimated potential incremental life loss associated with a failure of a dike is up to 17 people.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. \n\nBlackwater Dam is operated in conjunction with Franklin Falls Dam, and is staffed full time.  During high pools, Blackwater Dam is inspected on a daily basis.   When the pool continues to rise, engineers conduct a site visit to evaluate dam performance.  Geotechnical instrumentation data is reviewed regularly during normal pools and more frequently during high pools.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Webbers Falls Lock & Dam in 1973 with the purpose of Navigation.  The dam also provides, hydroelectric power, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits. Webbers Falls Lock & Dam is located in eastern part of Oklahoma on the Arkansas River, about 5 miles northwest of the City of Webbers Falls in Muskogee County. Webbers Falls Lock & Dam is comprised of a navigation lock chamber that maintains river levels and passes barges and boats up and down the river.  The project also includes an earthen fill embankment, a gated spillway, and a powerhouse that began operating in 1973 to generate power for the Muskogee County.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment of Webbers Falls in 2022 and classified the risk as moderate.  The risk is primarily driven by the potential for the spillway gates to fail due to debris impact or a barge strike.  Failure would lead to loss of navigation pool and inability to pass barge traffic. A large increase in downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail as the dam is not designed or operated to reduce downstream flooding, but instead for navigation purposes.  Widespread flooding could occur downstream as part of normal operation of the dam (when the gates are fully opened during a large flood). The most immediate flooding impacts would be to the towns of Webbers Falls and Gore.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk Webbers Falls Lock and Dam poses to the community. USACE is performing rehabilitation and painting of the deteriorated gates. A Major Rehabilitation Evaluation (MRE) Study is also planned for the project. The objective of the MRE is to evaluate the risk and reliability of the structure, as well as evaluating the economic benefits of several alternatives, including routine maintenance, major rehabilitation, or complete replacement of assets within the project.  \n\nOther actions to reduce the risk include conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the EAP to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam. Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal reservoir levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has an instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Bolivar dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate risk. Although Bolivar Dam has historically performed well, extreme rain events may cause areas downstream and leveed areas to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur in a very large rainfall event. This event could require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates and emergency spillway. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam\u2019s construction.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Bolivar Dam in 2017 and classified the risk associated with failure as low. This risk categorization is based on the risk of rare storm events occurring which would cause more rainfall than the dam can store safely. During such an event, the spillways have the potential to pass over 116,000 cubic feet of water per second. The operation of the spillway would be necessary to prevent the dam from overtopping and potentially breaching.\n\nWhile the Bolivar Dam spillway has never seen flow, if operated it could result in significant flooding in downstream communities from Zoar, OH to Dover, OH to New Philadelphia, OH. Depending on the amount of water released, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, gas, and water supply may occur. Critical infrastructure, including roadways (evacuation routes) and bridges along Sandy Creek and the Tuscarawas, may not be passable due to high flood waters during spillway flows. \n\nWhile rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach hillside to hillside quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location. In the unlikely event Bolivar Dam must pass these extreme waters, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family\u2019s lives at risk.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Bolivar Dam. The project is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts detailed inspections of the dam and levees during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being supported by conducting emergency exercises and dam safety training with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated to improve emergency response actions.",

This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Inundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.  More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",

    "projectDescription": "Dexter Dam is located on the Middle Fork Willamette River in Lowell, Oregon and 20 miles upstream of Eugene and Springfield, Oregon. Dexter Dam is a 90 ft tall, 2,319ft long rockfill earthen embankment dam with a 359 ft long concrete spillway equipped with seven spillway gates, regulating outlet, and a powerhouse. Dexter Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1947 and was completed in 1955. Dexter Dam is part of a system of 13 multi-purpose dams in the Willamette Valley with the primary purpose of flood risk management and secondary purposes of hydropower, recreation, irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply, fish and wildlife, and water quality. Collectively, this system of dams is referred to as the Willamette Valley Project.\n\nDexter Dam is 1 mile downstream of Lookout Point Dam. Dexter Dam is a re-regulating dam for Lookout Point and is operated to provide consistent flows into the river downstream while allowing for fluctuations in outflow from Lookout Point Dam. The re-regulation of flow allows for Lookout Point Dam's powerhouse to meet peak electricity demands on a daily basis for the region.\n\nDexter Dam is located about 70 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE continues to evaluate the condition and risks associated with its dams and will continue to review the risk associated with Dexter Dam in future routine studies. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and Dexter Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Dexter Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Aquilla Dam in May 1983 in accordance with the Flood Control Act approved 13 August 1968 (Public Law 90-483) (SD 52/90/1) and the Public Works Appropriation Act of 1958, approved 26 August 1957 (Public Law 85-167). It is located approximately 3 miles east of the city of Aquilla in Hill County, Texas. Aquilla Dam is operated for optimum flood reductions on the Brazos River, and is operated in conjunction with other Brazos River projects. The dam reduces the risk of downstream flooding on Aquilla Creek from the dam to the confluence of the Brazos River by holding back waters during heavy rain events. The dam is an earthen dam, approximately 2.2 miles long, with both a gated concrete conduit in the middle as well as an un-gated spillway on the eastern end. The gated concrete conduit, or pipe through the dam, is for releasing water in a regulated manner during and after flood events. The spillway on the eastern end holds water to 18-feet below the top of the dam; however, there are no gates to regulate water flows when the reservoir rises above that level. Any water above that level will flow downstream. Additional benefits of the dam are water supply, recreation, and fish and wildlife management.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Aquilla Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Aquilla Dam was designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment in June 2016 and classified the risk associated with the project as low. This classification is based on an extremely unlikely flood event which could cause overtopping of the embankment, water to flow through the dam\u2019s foundation near the concrete conduit and eventually weaken the dam, and instability of the embankment on the far western end. In the remote event of a dam breach, the largest impacts would be to the City of Waco, Texas located 25 river miles below the dam. In any of these unlikely scenarios, downstream flooding in Waco, Texas would occur within 10 hours of breach and could be as deep as a two-story structure destroying critical infrastructure such as fire stations, schools, and universities as well as residential, commercial, and industrial developments. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Aquilla Dam through the un-gated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and excess water flows through the spillway. Surcharge releases through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a two-story building. Although the large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans, and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "In order to lower the risks associated with the dam, inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam. Surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Routine maintenance and dam safety monitoring are performed to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. Additionally, Aquilla Dam is well maintained with an instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. The Emergency Action Plan is updated and exercised annually, improving emergency response and coordination between USACE elements and downstream federal, state, county, city agencies, and stakeholders. USACE also communicates risks associated with Aquilla Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Big Hill Dam in 1981 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities as well as water supply, fish and wildlife, and for recreation.  Big Hill Dam is located on Big Hill Creek, a tributary of the Verdigris River 5 miles east of Cherryvale, Kansas.  Big Hill Dam consists of an earth-fill embankment, a gate tower outlet works with a drop inlet, and a separate uncontrolled spillway.  The outlet works includes a wet well and water supply intake.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in May 2020 and classified the risk of Big Hill Dam as low. Although extremely unlikely, the two primary risks to the integrity of the dam are: (1) A flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded and water flows over the top of the dam, and (2) A flood so large that it flows through the auxiliary spillway and erodes the spillway bottom back to the lake resulting in additional releases.  Failure of the dam would result in flooding in Liberty, Kansas; Coffeyville, Kansas; and rural areas along the Verdigris River in Kansas and Oklahoma.  There is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation of the dam which could include large releases through the ungated spillway during a large flood.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Big Hill Dam poses to communities.  Along with routine inspections and surveys additional efforts include establishing emergency rock and sand stockpiles, emergency exercises, annual updates to the Emergency Action Plan, and development of a communication plan to communicate dam risks.  \nAdditionally, there are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Montgomery Locks and Dam across the Ohio River in 1936.  The dam is located in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, about 32 miles downstream of the head of the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The purpose of the dam is to create a navigation pool from the dam upstream to Dashields Locks and Dam, which is located near Edgeworth, Pennsylvania. The dam is concrete and has 10 steel gates, which help control river levels near the dam.  The lock provides a lift of nearly 18 feet, from the pool downstream of the dam (lower pool) to the pool above the dam (upper pool).  The lock allows river traffic to travel upstream or downstream of the dam.  The lock includes of a main rectangular lock chamber that is 110 feet wide by 600 feet long and a second, auxiliary chamber, that is 56 feet wide by 360 feet long.  The lock chambers are adjacent to each other and are formed on each side by concrete walls and steel gates on the upstream and downstream sides.  The economic benefit of shipping materials and goods through the lock is more than 290 million dollars annually.  Water intakes are located in the upper pool which provides water supply to municipal and industrial agencies. The dam does not provide the nearby communities with any protection from flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment of the dam was performed in 2019, which characterized the risk as low. The assessment identified three scenarios that could cause the dam to fail: 1)  Under normal river levels the steel dam gates could collapse due to corrosion; 2) During times of high river levels, barges in the upper pool could become trapped on the dam, which could prevent one or more dam gates from closing; and 3) When one of the gates is under repair, a bulkhead is in place, and there are high river levels, barges in the upper pool could collide with the bulkhead, causing it to collapse.  Any of these three scenarios, although very unlikely, could result in a loss of the upper pool to the extent that river traffic would be halted. If the upper pool were lost, the primary consequence would be the loss of shipping and water supply, which would damage the regional economy by more than 290 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping and water supply.  Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail, and the upper pool was lost.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the economy, we have replaced all of the dam gates, which are designed to withstand barge impacts.  Because all of the gates have been replaced, the bulkhead is no longer needed, except for future short-term maintenance.  We will continue to work closely with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association, and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and changes to lock operations. We regularly update our emergency action plan. We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the riverbed, and the locks and dam.  We conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communications and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the dam\u2019s upper pool or may adversely affect navigations.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high river events may occur to provide information for any necessary public or industry notifications. We closely monitor river levels and provide advisories if river levels may become unsafe for shipping.  Information on river levels and forecasts are available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttp://water.weather.gov/ahps2/forecasts.php?wfo=pbz",

    "projectDescription": "Pleasant Hill Dam is located on the Clear Fork River, a tributary of the Mohican River. The dam is located approximately 2.5 miles south of Perrysville, Ohio. Completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1938, the dam and its appurtenant structures are part of the Muskingum Watershed flood control system. The dam is a rolled earthen and rock structure with an impervious core. The main spillway is an uncontrolled \u201cmorning glory\u201d type, which consists of a large concrete funnel, transitioning into a 700 feet long tunnel which exits into a stilling basin at the toe of the dam. The stilling basin was designed to dissipate the energy of the flowing water from the tunnel, thereby reducing erosion. The auxiliary spillway and fuse plug are used to channel excess water away from the dam during high water events. The auxiliary spillway is an earthen channel that stretches 1,700 feet and releases into the Black Fork of the Mohican River. Across the opening of the spillway is a fuse plug composed primarily of clay that was completed in 2002. The fuse plug restricts water from flowing through the spillway until it is overtopped. The fuse plug will then erode and create access for the water to enter the spillway. The delay in spillway flow allows more time for emergency notification to the residents of Perrysville and other downstream communities in the case of flooding.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE currently identifies the risk associated with failure of the Pleasant Hill Dam as moderate to high. Erosion along the dam toe and left abutment are the main failures that could occur at Pleasant Hill Dam. In one area, the dam is founded on sand and gravel below a natural clay layer. In this area there has been some clear seepage of water under the dam. While this type of seepage is normal for dams in the area, USACE staff at the project are trained to observe for unusual flow and address them if found.\n\nIf an uncontrolled flood occurred, water would flood some low-lying portions of Perrysville from the auxiliary spillway.  Additionally, Black Fork is a tributary of the Mohican River; therefore, failure of the spillway would further inundate towns downstream of the Pleasant Hill Dam. The town of Greer, Ohio is the closest town downstream of the dam, followed by Brinkhaven and Walhonding, Ohio. Perrysville would suffer the most immediate damage, while the other three would face later flooding as the Mohican River swells from the additional water of the spillway.\n\nIf uncontrolled flows occurred due to overtopping erosion of the dam, the town of Loudonville, located on Clear Fork of Mohican River about 2-3 miles from the confluence with Black Fork of the Mohican River (7 miles downstream of the dam), would be flooded due to backwater effects during this potential failure mode.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "Pleasant Hill Dam is being well maintained with management addressing operational issues as part of the USACE\u2019s ongoing maintenance program. The spillway and dike were both found to be in good condition at the latest inspection. Furthermore, the dike should allow ample warning time for residents of Perrysville to evacuate in the case of flooding before water reaches the spillway. Finally, the auxiliary spillway is long enough so the likelihood of complete erosion is minimal, decreasing the likelihood of flooding to Perrysville. \nIn 2020, USACE developed an Interim Risk Reduction Measure plan for the Dam. This process reviewed all likely failure modes for Pleasant Hill Dam and made recommendations to reduce the consequences of a failure or overtopping. Among the recommendation are better emergency action plans, development of emergency exercises with local stakeholders as well as increased monitoring and inspections.",

    "projectDescription": "Fort Randall Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Operating since 1953, it is the second-most downstream of six projects built on the mainstem of the upper Missouri River which, in combination with dams on the river\u2019s tributaries, reduce the risk of downstream flooding along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, this \u201cmainstem\u201d system of dams is managed to balance hydropower generation, water supply, water quality, irrigation, fish and wildlife conservation, navigation, and recreation benefits.  \n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet structure for releasing stored water, a powerhouse, and a gated spillway used to release excess water during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, USACE releases up to 44,500 cubic feet of water per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons) through the powerhouse to manage reservoir elevations and generate power. As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, water also is released through four outlet tunnels which, combined, are capable of releasing up to 128,000 cfs. When reservoir levels from extreme storms or snowmelt exceed the outlet structure\u2019s release capacity, additional releases are made through the 21 spillway gates to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to release an additional 633,000 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release. \n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Fort Randall Dam as a result of flooding was approximately 160,000 cfs from the powerhouse, outlet structure, and spillway in 2011. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Fort Randall Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can the system of dams in which it operates). While unlikely, a non-breach releases when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n\nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threats that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, are erosion of the dam\u2019s foundation from water flowing beneath the embankment, damage to the spillway during non-breach releases, and overtopping. Although these scenarios are extremely unlikely, a breach of the dam or spillway would require historic water releases from Gavin\u2019s Point Dam (located on the Missouri River downstream of Fort Randall) to preserve its structural integrity. In an extreme case, water from Fort Randall could exceed the storage capacity of Gavins Point leading to overtopping and \u201ccascading\u201d dam failure. Over the course of days to weeks, these flows would result in swift, deep, and life-threatening flooding in numerous communities (both with and without levees) along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 16 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in February 1937 for the purpose of navigation. Lock and Dam 16 is located on the Mississippi River near Muscatine, Iowa. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary miter gate bay, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section, a concrete ogee spillway, a submersible earth dike, and a non-submersible earth dike. The main lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The lock chamber can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 9 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 3,940 feet and includes 1,099 feet of movable gate section, 1,700 feet of concrete ogee spillway, 726 feet of submersible earth dike, and 415 feet of non-submersible earthen dike. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in June 2016 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 16 as very low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from scour leading to dam instability, a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock, and instability of the downstream guide wall. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 16. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "Garrison Dam and Reservoir is owned, operated, and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Operating since 1955, it is the second-most upstream of six projects built on the mainstem of the upper Missouri River which, in combination with dams on the river\u2019s tributaries, reduce the risk of downstream flooding along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, this \u201cmainstem\u201d system of dams is managed to balance hydropower generation, water supply, water quality, irrigation, fish and wildlife conservation, navigation, and recreation benefits.  \n\nThe dam consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet structure for releasing stored water, a powerhouse, and a gated spillway to release excess water during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, USACE releases up to 41,000 cubic feet of water per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons) through five powerhouse outlet tunnels to manage reservoir elevations and generate power. As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, water also is released through three additional outlet tunnels which, combined, can release up to 98,000 cfs. When reservoir levels from extreme storms or snowmelt exceed the outlet structure\u2019s release capacity, additional releases can be made using 28 spillway gates to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to additionally release up to 827,000 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a \u201cnon-breach\u201d release. \n\nFor perspective, the largest release of water from Garrison Dam as a result of flooding was a total of 150,000 cfs from the powerhouse  outlet structure tunnels, and the spillway in 2011. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Garrison Dam continues to reliably reduce floods, it alone cannot eliminate the risk of flooding (nor can the system of dams in which it operates). While unlikely, a non-breach releases when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.\n\nWhen USACE last assessed the dam\u2019s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threats that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, are damage to the spillway during non-breach releases and erosion of the dam\u2019s foundation from water flowing beneath the embankment. Although these scenarios are very unlikely, failure of the dam or spillway would require historic water releases from the downstream Missouri River dams (Oahe, Big Bend, Fort Randall, and Gavins Point) to preserve their structural integrity. In an extreme case, water from Garrison could exceed the storage capacities of these dams, leading to overtopping and \u201ccascading\u201d dam failures. Over the course of days to weeks, these flows would result in swift, deep, and life-threatening flooding in numerous communities (both with and without levees) along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities). \n\nUSACE categorized the risk associated with Garrison Dam as \u201chigh\u201d among its more than 700 dams due to the potential loss of life and large, national-scale consequences should an unlikely breach occur. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure.  Please note that some scenarios in this database for the six USACE dams on the upper Missouri River do not depict the full extent of downstream inundation including the extent of \u201ccascading\u201d inundation that could develop from upstream Missouri River dam failure(s).

Following flooding in 2011, and the first-ever use of the spillway, multiple foundation drainage systems were upgraded to prevent water from eroding the dam\u2019s foundation and numerous repairs have been made to the spillway to improve its resiliency during future flood events.

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates and maintains more than 700 dams across the United States. A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a risk assessment for Greenup Locks and Dam in 2021 and classified the risk associated with failure as low. \n\nInundation maps and consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no potential loss of life should it fail or mis-operate. This dam is designed with limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. During high flow events, the dam functions as a run-of-the-river project, allowing the river to pass through naturally. Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of the Old Hickory Lock and Dam in June of 1954 with the powerhouse being completed in December of 1957.  The dam is located in Davidson and Sumner Counties, TN on the Cumberland River approximately 216 river miles above its confluence with the Ohio River.  The project was authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1946 as a unit of a comprehensive development plan for the Cumberland River Basin. and is managed by the Nashville District, USACE.  Old Hickory Lake is a mainstream storage impoundment on the Cumberland River operated by the Corps of Engineers.  The dam has a maximum height of 40 feet, a total length of 3,750 feet, and consists of a concrete gravity section, earthen embankment, powerhouse, and lock.  Old Hickory Lock and Dam impounds Old Hickory Lake which has a total storage capacity of 545,000 acre-ft.  In addition to its originally authorized purposes of navigation and hydropower, Old Hickory Lock and Dam provides recreation, minor flood control, fish and wildlife, water supply, and water quality benefits for the basin and region.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The project risk is currently driven by the consequences of an overtopping failure of the compacted clay embankment.  The major damage center impacted by a failure of Old Hickory would be Nashville, with the area between Old Hickory through Davidson County being urban with a significant population. Further downstream into Cheatham and Dickson Counties, the areas impacted are predominantly rural.  The population at risk is estimated to be 30,000.  There are currently no operating restrictions in place and no plans to change how water releases are managed.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase the frequency of this monitoring during lake levels rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of Great Salt Plains Dam in 1941 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding in downstream communities. The dam consists of an earthen embankment and a concrete spillway. The project is located on the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River about 3 miles southeast of Vining. OK in Alfalfa County.  During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream for communities along the Salt Fork and Arkansas Rivers.  This stored water can then be released in a more controlled manner to reduce dangerous flooding.  these releases are regulated by four ungated conduits within a concrete spillway.  For larger floods, releases are made over an ungated spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2023 and classified the risk associated with Great Salt Plains Dam as very low. This classification is based both on the remote potential for dam breach and the populations living downstream of the dam that would be flooded if breach were to occur. Although extremely unlikely, the primary risk to the integrity of the dam is water seeping through the foundation leading to breach of the dam. Failure of the dam would include flooding downstream, economic impacts, and potential loss of life. In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the cities of Nash, Jefferson, Pond Creek, Lamont, Tonkawa, and other communities along the Salt Fork of Arkansas River. There is also flood risk associated with the dam due to normal operation of the dam which could include large releases through the ungated spillway during a large flood.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk that is posed to downstream communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the EAP to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. These instruments are monitored regularly for any early indications of potential safety concerns at the project.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Alaska District built Moose Creek Dam across the Chena River in 1979 to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in Fairbanks and the surrounding area.  Moose Creek Dam is located southeast of the City of North Pole, Alaska, and approximately 15 miles east-southeast of the City of Fairbanks, Alaska.  Since it went into operation, the dam has reduced damages caused by downstream flooding by an estimated $420 million.  The dam does not typically retain water, however, when there is a large storm event, the dam gates are closed and water is purposely pooled in the floodway to prevent downstream damages.  If the event is large enough, the water will travel the length of the floodway and discharge into the Tanana River.  Besides flood control, the project also provides opportunities to enhance the environment for wildlife and is used for recreational purposes.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Moose Creek Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding.   When the dam impounds water, the groundwater in the community is usually elevated and low-lying areas are flooded, especially in the neighboring community of North Pole and the Steamboat Landing area along the Chena River.  \n\nUnlikely scenarios that could result in devastating downstream flooding from Moose Creek Dam include an uncontrolled high-volume release of water due to erosion of the dam's foundation soils during significant rainfall and snowmelt events.  Historically, the water behind the dam has never been higher than one third of the dam's height. It is uncertain how well the dam and its foundation soils will perform at higher levels.  Lastly, devastating floodwaters from the Tanana River can reach the dam by flowing backwards through the floodway and into the Chena River.  The Tanana River waters could cause similar catastrophic problems to the dam's foundation.\n\nIf the dam were to fail, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out, flooding downstream communities.  The City of North Pole is directly downstream of the dam and would be flooded, with little or no warning. Fort Wainwright and the City of Fairbanks, which are further downstream, would also experience extensive flooding, but are likely have greater warning times.  \n\nAlthough very unlikely, a dam breach would result in downstream floodwater being swift and deep, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking multiple steps necessary to reduce risk to the public.  First, USACE is designing ways to protect the dam's foundation from erosion.  Additionally, USACE works closely with state and local emergency managers to conduct emergency exercises and to keep emergency action plans current.  Annual inspections and regular maintenance are conducted to ensure the dam is functioning as intended.  USACE rigorously monitors and surveys the dam, especially during high-water events.  USACE also follows rainfall forecasts to predict when high-water events may occur, and to provide information for any necessary flood warnings to agency partners.  Also, USACE works with local emergency managers to help residents understand how they can prepare for a flood.",

    "projectDescription": "The construction of Mississippi River Lock and Dam 14 was completed and placed into service by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in December 1938 for the purpose of navigation. Lock and Dam 14 is located on the Mississippi River near Pleasant Valley, Iowa. The project consists of a main lock chamber, an auxiliary lock chamber, and a dam that consists of a movable gate section and a non-submersible earth dike. The main lock chamber is used to raise or lower river traffic between the upstream and downstream pools to navigate past the dam. The auxiliary chamber is used to raise or lower pleasure boats and the government fleet between the upstream and downstream pools between Memorial Day and Labor Day. The lock chambers can raise or lower river traffic a maximum of 11 feet, depending on the river conditions. The dam has an overall length of 2,700 feet and includes 1,343 feet of movable gate section and 1,357 feet of non-submersible earthen dike. During flood events on the Mississippi River, the dam gates are raised out of the water to produce an open river condition. Once water levels recede, the gates are lowered to maintain the 9-foot navigation channel upstream of the dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in April 2015 and classified the risk associated with Lock and Dam 14 as low. The assessment investigated the risks to the project from a large flood event overtopping the non-submersible earthen dike causing a dam failure, barge impacts to the spillway gates, and a barge impact on the miter gates resulting in an extensive shutdown of the lock. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only and a lock shutdown was estimated to be short enough to result in no substantial economic damages to navigation. There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Lock and Dam 14. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam\u2019s performance under changing river conditions. The dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities\u2019 emergency response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "John Day Lock & Dam is located on the Columbia River 27 miles upstream of The Dalles, Ore., and 47 miles upstream of Hood River, Ore.  John Day Lock & Dam is a 230 ft tall, 5,900 ft long structure consisting of a rockfill embankment dam, concrete gravity dam with a concrete spillway with twenty spillway gates, a navigation lock, two fish ladders, and a powerhouse with sixteen generating units. John Day Lock & Dam is owned, operated, and maintained by the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Construction of the dam began in 1959 and was completed in 1968.  The powerhouse began operation in 1971. John Day Lock & Dam is located at the downstream end of Columbia River watershed, which is approximately the size of France (240,000 square miles). Once a river with large fluctuations in flow throughout the year, the flow is regulated by hundreds of dams upstream including large reservoirs in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Canada. John Day Lock & Dam is specifically authorized to provide flood risk management, navigation, hydropower, irrigation, fish & wildlife conservation, and recreation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a routine risk assessment for John Day Lock & Dam in 2017 that characterized the risk associated with the dam to be Low. The assessment considered a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely.  USACE performs risk assessments as part of an ongoing dam safety program and to assist in the prioritization of investment for aging infrastructure.  The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken.    \n\nUSACE is confident that its dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to provide significant benefits for the region. Dams reduce flood risks. However, dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams.  Flooding can be caused by high flows from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams. John Day Lock & Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance.  USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. John Day Lock & Dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.",

Arcadia Dam is located on the Deep Fork River in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma.  The project is located 1.5 miles southwest of Arcadia, Oklahoma, 5 miles east of Edmond, Oklahoma, and 12 miles northeast of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream.  After the storm passes and the downstream river level recedes, the water can be safety released into the river.  Water storage and releases are managed by a gated outlet works.  The project consists of an earthen embankment and an uncontrolled spillway.  Arcadia Dam also provides water supply and recreation benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "North Branch of Kokosing Dam was constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 1972 for flood risk reduction in the Muskingum River Basin of southeast Ohio. The dam is located on the North Branch of Kokosing River approximately 9 miles upstream from its confluence with the Kokosing River. Fredericktown, Ohio is the closest town to the dam, sitting 2.2 miles to the northwest.\n\nThe project is composed of an earthen embankment, a vertical intake, a stilling basin, a concrete-lined spillway, and a dike. The primary use of the project is flood control, but other uses include recreation and conservation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE classifies the risk associated with failure of North Branch Kokosing Dam as moderate. Residents and structures at Fredericktown, Ohio would face the first consequences of a dam failure, as it lies 3 miles downstream from the dam. The main potential failures associated with North Branch of Kokosing Dam are water overtopping the dam, leakage behind the spillway wall, and erosion of the embankment or spillway. All three would create flooding downstream that could destroy homes, business, roads, bridges, and railroads in surrounding communities.\nOvertopping the dam could occur during an intense precipitation event that could fill the reservoir completely. Furthermore, the concrete walls of the spillway could fail due to seepage behind the walls, or the earthen dam could erode from water accumulation inside the dam. Both would create the same flooding event as water overtopping the dam.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE has several measures in place to minimize risk at North Branch of Kokosing Dam. Dam overtopping would most likely occur during an extremely high precipitation event. Such an event is unlikely to occur under current climatic conditions; additionally, USACE monitors water levels consistently, which grants substantial warning time to evacuate downstream communities if a concerning amount of precipitation were to accumulate. Structures exist to minimize seepage along the spillway and earthen embankment. Furthermore, personnel inspect the dam and spillway regularly to ensure minimal erosion risk within the structures. Both were found to be in excellent shape during the last inspection.",

    "projectDescription": "The Trinidad Dam project is owned and operated by the Albuquerque District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The project includes a dam located on the Purgatoire River in Las Animas County, Colorado, approximately two river miles upstream of the city of Trinidad and roughly 140 river miles from its confluence with the Arkansas River at the city of Las Animas.  Construction was completed in 1977 and primary project features include a zoned earthen embankment dam; gated outlet works to adjust operational water releases into the Purgatoire River; and two spillways to pass much larger, uncontrolled flows during extreme events.  During flood events, the Trinidad dam project can be operated for flood risk reduction on its own or in conjunction with other dams to optimize upstream and downstream flood risks within the Arkansas River basin.  In addition to the project\u2019s main purpose to provide flood risk reduction, it is also authorized for sediment retention, irrigation, and recreation benefits.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although the Trinidad Dam project has successfully reduced flooding, it does not eliminate all flood risk caused by rainfall downstream of the dam or due to emergency operation of the project.  During infrequent emergency operation, larger required releases through the project\u2019s gated outlet works could surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Purgatoire and Arkansas Rivers.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled flow through the spillways has never occurred, uncontrolled spillway flows could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Purgatoire and Arkansas Rivers, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Purgatoire and Arkansas Rivers to John Martin Reservoir.  Impacted communities include Trinidad, El Moro, Hoehne, Las Animas, and communities located in between.\n\nUSACE completed a risk assessment of the Trinidad Dam project in 2018.  Results characterize dam breach risk as LOW due to the combination of life loss consequences and low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the result of an extreme event.  Specifically, the occurrence of dam breach caused by overtopping the dam was identified as the consequence of an extreme storm event (less than 1 in 200,000 year or 0.0005% per year).  The annual probability of dam breach due to overtopping caused by an extreme storm event is estimated to be low (1 in 2,000,000).  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation would be life-threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Purgatoire and Arkansas Rivers to John Martin Reservoir.  Impacted communities include Trinidad, El Moro, Hoehne, Las Animas, and communities located in between.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquakes or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included installation of new instruments to improve performance monitoring, maintenance of riverbank erosion, routine vegetation removal, and gate component rehabilitation with gate repainting scheduled.  Risk communication activities include tabletop emergency exercises with first responders and other Federal, State, and local agencies.  Future risk communication activities include revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and development of a formal risk communication plan.  Flood warnings to notify affected communities downstream of the project are coordinated with external entities.",

More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Dams do not eliminate all risk of flooding. USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

    "projectDescription": "The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Fort Gibson Dam in 1953 with the primary purpose to reduce flooding downstream as well as hydropower generation, water supply, and navigation.  Fort Gibson is located on Grand River, about 5 miles north of Fort Gibson, Oklahoma and approximately 12 miles northeast of Muskogee, Oklahoma.  During large storm events, the dam holds back excess water to reduce flooding downstream. Water storage and releases are managed by a large gated spillway.  This spillway is flanked on each side by concrete dam sections and earthen embankments.  The project also includes a hydroelectric power plant that began operating in 1953 that generates power for the community of Mayes, Wagoner, and Cherokee Counties. The total length of the dam including the spillway is 2,990 feet, and the maximum height above the streambed is 110 feet. Oklahoma State Highway 251A runs across the top of the dam, which connects the towns of Okay and Fort Gibson.  Associated with the Dam is also Oklahoma Ordnance Works Levee and seven dikes. Oklahoma Ordnance Works Levee (OOWL) is located in Pryor, OK. Dikes 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, and 11 prevent Fort Gibson pool from crossing over to the Verdigris River Basin during high lake levels. In addition, Dikes 1, 2, and 3 protect the town of Okay from Fort Gibson reservoir. Dike 10 protects the town of Wagoner, Oklahoma from the flood pools associated with Fort Gibson Dam.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment in 2015 and classified the risk associated with Fort Gibson Dam as low. Although extremely unlikely, the primary risks to the integrity of the dam are the potential for: (1) sliding or overturning of the concrete dam sections during high lake levels, and (2) water seeping at the base of the earthen dam eventually weakens the dam and leads to embankment slope failure. In the remote event of a dam failure, the most immediate impacted areas with the major population center would be the towns of Fort Gibson, Muskogee, and Okay. Other impacted areas include the towns of River Bottom, Webbers Falls, Moffett, Arkoma, Pocola, and Ft. Smith.  Failure of the dam would result in widespread flooding in these areas resulting in loss of life and damage to infrastructure along the river and within the inundation path. \nA more likely flooding scenario is the potential for large releases out of the spillway gates due to a large flood as part of normal operation.  Although the flooding for this scenario would be less than expected for a dam breach life loss and economic impacts could still occur due to the extent of flooding.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Fort Gibson Dam poses to the surrounding communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the project. Additionally, the dam and dikes are well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the project during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structures. Lastly, the dam has an instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.",

Therefore, in the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, water would not overflow the riverbanks. If the dam failed during a large flood the dam itself would not affect the extent of flooding since it was not storing water.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Lock & Dam 9 in 1937.  The project is located on the Mississippi River near Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. USACE operates Lock & Dam 9 primarily for navigation purposes, but congress also authorized USACE to make recreation improvements associated with the pool formed above the dam. Additionally, environmental management on the river is coordinated with the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources, and other state & federal agencies. The main components of the project include a lock, a gated spillway structure with 5 roller gates and 8 Tainter gates, an overflow weir, and 1.7 miles of earthen embankments connecting these other components. The embankment sections have a crest elevation of 632.3 feet (NAVD 88) and a maximum height of 27 feet.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Lock & Dam 9 is a run-of-river dam that maintains a navigation pool for river traffic but does not store flood waters. The gated spillway is regulated to hold a constant pool level for navigation purposes at elevation 619.3 up to river flows of 63,000 cfs.  The 63,000 cfs flow is exceeded about 20% of the time and occurs most years (primarily in the spring).  Above this flow, the gates are fully opened, and the dam has less than one foot of impact on the river stages. The maximum water level differential across the dam is 9 feet and occurs at low river flows.  Based upon a risk assessment in 2019, USACE considers Lock & Dam 9 to be a very low risk dam among its more than 700 dams. Identified risks are primarily due to aging miter gates in the locks, and potential for navigation accidents.  Other risks include the failure of the earth dam due to overtopping or scour at the overflow spillways.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.   Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  Other hazards exist, such as swimming and boat safety in the vicinity of the dam.  USACE regularly engages the public to raise awareness of the dam; and coordinates with state and county emergency managers (particularly during river flood events).",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed Union City Dam across French Creek in 1970 to hold back water during flood events to reduce the risk of downstream flooding in the low-lying communities in Waterford, Cambridge Springs, Saegertown, Meadville, and additional towns along French Creek in Crawford, Erie, Venango, and Mercer County. The dam is located about 3 miles northwest of Union City, Pennsylvania and forms the Union City Reservoir.  Union City Dam has reduced flood damage by more than an estimated $110 million since being commissioned. The reservoir stores rainfall and passively releases water during and after flood events to diminish potential flood damage along French Creek.  Union City Dam is composed of an earthen (embankment) portion and has a maximum height of 88 feet and a length of about 1,400 feet.  The dam has a system of outlets, including a concrete conduit that discharges directly downstream of the dam during periods of normal reservoir levels.  There is a concrete basin on the right side of the dam that allows water into a spillway during periods of unusually high reservoir levels and around the dam to the downstream French Creek; water enters the concrete basin from the reservoir over a concrete surface called a weir.  There is a narrow opening in the weir that allows water to enter the concrete basin during periods of normal, but elevated reservoir levels.  Since the project began operation in 1970, the reservoir level has never risen above the top of the concrete weir and so people along French Creek downstream of Union City Dam have not experienced flooding related to full spillway flow.",
    "riskCharSummary": "The most recent risk assessment for Union City was completed in 2024, which characterized the risk posed by the dam as very low.  The dam was well-constructed and is well-maintained.  However, multiple populations live downstream of Union City Dam, including those in Waterford, Cambridge Springs, Saegertown, Meadville, and other low-lying communities along French Creek in Crawford, Erie, Venango, and Mercer County. Although the dam reduces the risk of flooding to these communities, it does not eliminate flooding. The most likely scenario resulting in downstream flooding from Union City Dam would be a high-volume release over the dam\u2019s spillway during an unusually large and intense storm event.  Water released over the spillway could create conditions similar to how French Creek would behave if the dam had not been constructed.  \n\nTwo less likely, but far more devastating flooding scenarios exist during extreme rainfall events. 1.) If the reservoir level rises about the crest of the embankment dam, water will flow over the downstream face of the earthen embankment, eroding the embankment, potentially leading to a breach.  2.) Water flowing over the spillway could increase water pressures beneath the spillway weir or erode the bedrock that supports the spillway weir to the extent that concrete portions of the spillway weir breaches (i.e., moves downstream and releases additional water to the downstream French Creek).  Although such a precipitation event leading to a breach is extremely rare, it is a possibility.\n\nIn either scenario, a large surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Communities, including Waterford, that are closer to the dam, are in more immediate danger of flood and may have little advanced warning.  Cities and communities further downstream of the dam, such as Cambridge Springs, Saegertown, Meadville and communities in Crawford, Venango, and Mercer County may have larger populations and possibly less awareness of the dam but will have more warning. \n\nWith either of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, possibly overflowing banks on French Creek, destroying buildings and infrastructure.  Anyone caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenario, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public, we will continue to work closely with state and local emergency managers, conduct emergency exercises and incorporate any new information into our emergency action plans.  We will continue rigorous monitoring and surveillance of the dam and will do so more frequently during high-water events.  We closely follow rainfall forecasts to determine when high-water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.  We will work with local communities to provide opportunities to engage with residents to help them understand how they can better prepare for a flood.  In partnership with the US Geologic Survey and the National Weather Service, information on current lake levels at Union City Reservoir is available to the public via the internet at:  \n\nhttps://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/03021518/#dataTypeId=continuous-62615-1922206742&period=P7D&showMedian=true",

A dam is an earthen embankment and/or solid concrete structure that is built across a river, stream, or other waterway to temporarily hold back and store water that would otherwise flow downstream. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates have been developed for this dam since there is potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated.  This dam is authorized, designed, and operated for hydropower, water supply, and flood damage reduction and stores water for those purposes.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure, severe downstream flooding would occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to store water to reduce downstream flooding that would occur naturally.   But during a very large flood, flooding would occur downstream, and failure would result in catastrophic flooding downstream.  Flood mapping has been developed to indicate potential flooding extents during a range of river conditions for both breach and non-breach scenarios.  These maps should be used by the public and state and local emergency managers for their awareness and preparedness in the event of a dam breach incident.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE manages dam-related flood risks by assessing the condition of the dam by monitoring and routine inspection.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.  USACE prioritizes maintenance and repairs that will most impact the risks, and engages upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related incident. USACE periodically updates the emergency action plan for this dam and periodically convenes with state and local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and to support the development of state and local preparedness and response plans.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction on Beech Fork Dam in 1977. Beech Fork Dam is located on Beech Fork, a tributary of Twelvepole Creek, approximately 4 miles above the mouth of Beech Fork, 16 miles above the confluence of Twelvepole Creek and the Ohio River at Ceredo, West Virginia. The dam is in Wayne County near Lavalette, West Virginia. Beech Fork dam reduces the risk of flooding for Wayne and Cabell County and has a drainage area of approximately 80 square miles. While reducing flood risk, the water held behind the dam creates Beech Fork Lake and provides a place to recreate. Although flood risk management is the project\u2019s primary focus, the project is also authorized for water conservation for general recreation, fish and wildlife management, and water quality control. The dam structure is primary and earthen embankment with an intake tower and concrete lined spillway.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Beech Fork Dam supported by the Periodic Assessment (PA) conducted in January 2020. The dam and other project features were found to be acceptable with no noted major issues. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to the downstream communities. However, it does not eliminate the risk. Beech Fork Dam has historically performed well, though future extreme rainfall events could create a scenario for significant flooding downstream of the dam. The incremental risk is mostly driven by the potential for overtopping of the embankment. This scenario would mean extreme rainfall within the watershed leading to water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam, and leading to a failure. The driving factor of this risk is the relatively large population downstream of the dam. The main population centers impacted by flooding from Beech Fork Dam include Lavalette, Shoals, Westmoreland, and West Huntington, West Virginia. While this scenario is considered extremely unlikely, Beech Fork Dam has an emergency action plan to lower the risk of life loss if this extreme event would occur.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk at Beech Fork Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being pursued through coordination with local emergency management entities along with dam safety training with USACE staff and local and state emergency responders. Additionally, the dam\u2019s Emergency Action Plan is routinely updated in an effort to improve emergency response actions.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed construction of Navarro Mills Dam in May 1963 in accordance with the Flood Control Act approved 3 September 1954 (PL 780, 83rd Congress, 2nd Session), and as modified by the provisions of the Flood Control Act approved 3 July 1958 (PL 85-500, 85th Congress, 2nd Session) and in Advice of Allotment C-126, 6 October 1958. It is located approximately 16 miles southwest of the City of Corsicana in Navarro County, Texas. The dam reduces the risk of downstream flooding along Richland Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River, by holding back waters during heavy rain events. The dam is an earthen embankment, approximately 1.4 miles long, with a gated concrete spillway on the eastern end. The gated spillway is controlled by six tainter gates that hold water to 14 feet below the top of the dam to regulate water storage and releases. The gated spillway also contains two low-flow gated conduits, or openings through the dam, for releasing water in a regulated manner during and after flood events. Additional benefits of the dam are water supply, fish and wildlife management, and recreation.",
    "riskCharSummary": "Although Navarro Mills Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, the dam does not eliminate the risk of flooding. Navarro Mills Dam was designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment in April 2017 and classified the risks associated with the project as very low. This classification is based on an extremely unlikely flood event which could cause several equally unlikely scenarios including overtopping at a low spot in the embankment, water to seep through the dam and eventually weaken the dam, and inoperability of the spillway gates leading to overtopping of the gates. In the remote event of a dam breach, the largest impacts would be to the City of Purdon, TX, located approximately 9 miles downstream of the dam. In any of these unlikely scenarios, downstream flooding in Purdon, TX would occur within 3 hours of breach and could be as deep as a two-story structure, destroying buildings and critical infrastructure. In addition, some evacuation routes would be under water, increasing evacuation distances. The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding is high volume releases from Navarro Mills Dam through the gated spillway during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded and the spillway gates are opened to allow excess water to flow through the spillway. Surcharge releases through the spillway during the largest expected flood in the watershed would put thousands of people at risk and flood waters could be as deep as a one-story building. Although the large downstream communities have well-practiced emergency action plans, and local emergency managers are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure, breach of the dam would result in significant loss of life and severe economic damages.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "In order to lower the risks associated with the dam, inspections and monitoring are performed regularly to ensure the health and safety of the dam. Surveillance and inspections are increased as the lake elevation rises. Routine maintenance and dam safety monitoring are performed to ensure the dam is functioning as designed. New instruments were installed in the embankment above the left abutment of the concrete gated spillway in 2014 to monitor the amount of water seeping through the dam. The downstream left and right abutments of the gated concrete spillway was repaired in 2018 and 2021, respectively, after a shallow embankment slide caused damage to the riprap and embankment. The repairs include reconstructing the slope, replacing the riprap and bedding material, and constructing a new drainage swale. Additionally, Navarro Mills Dam is well maintained with an instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions. The Emergency Action Plan is updated and exercised annually, improving emergency response and coordination between USACE elements and downstream federal, state, county, city agencies, and stakeholders. USACE also communicates risks associated with Navarro Mills Dam annually with stakeholders and Emergency Managers.",

    "riskCharSummary": "Breach risk for this dam has been asssessed to be low.  Flood inundation maps and breach consequence estimates were not produced for this dam since there is no estimated potential loss of life should it fail or be mis-operated. This dam has limited storage during normal and low water operations to ensure adequate flows to support navigation. This dam is not authorized, designed, or operated for flood damage reduction.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure with low or normal water flows in the river, widespread flooding would not occur.  During high flow events, the dam is operated to pass water as quickly as it arrives.  During a large flood, the river channel and floodplain control river elevations so if the dam failed, the failure would produce negligible additional effects on the extent of flooding.",

    "projectDescription": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed Buckhorn Lake Dam in late 1959, starting full operation in 1960. The Buckhorn Lake Dam is located on the Middle Fork of the Kentucky River, 43.3 miles above its confluence with the Kentucky River. The project is located in Southeastern Kentucky, approximately 20 miles northwest of Hazard, Kentucky and 0.5 miles south of Buckhorn, Kentucky. The dam operates as a unit with Carr Creek Lake to reduce flooding in the Kentucky River Basin with the areas that are most directly benefited include the cities of Buckhorn and Beattyville, Kentucky. The Buckhorn Lake project consists of a 1,020-foot rock filled dam with a central clay core, having a maximum height of 160 feet above streambed, a gate controlled outlet works along the right abutment of the dam, and a gate controlled, open cut spillway through the right abutment ridge. The project also has a drainage area of 408 square miles. The record pool elevation of 839.4 feet occurred on 18 March 1963.",
    "riskCharSummary": "USACE completed a risk assessment for Buckhorn Lake Dam in 2022 that characterizes the risk of the project as low risk. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities. However, it does not completely eliminate the risk. Although the Buckhorn Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall may cause areas downstream to be flooded.  Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam spillway. The dam can only hold rainfall that occurs upstream of the dam. This region is prone to flash flooding due to the steep terrain. A potential failure mode is erosion of the dam's earthen embankment during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach of the dam. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled surge of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding along the Middle Fork of the Kentucky River. The largest impacts\nwould be to Buckhorn, Kentucky, directly below the dam. Low lying areas along the Middle Fork and the main stem of the Kentucky River would experience heavy flooding. The communities of Buckhorn, Beattyville, Irvine/Ravenna are the largest population areas impacted. Lesser flooding would be experienced along the Kentucky River to its confluence with the Ohio River.\n\nUpstream impacts to roadways will occur when the reservoir approaches Elevations above 805 ft NGVD29. These impacts increase in depth and duration at higher pool elevations and restrict residential access to many homes along State Hwy 257. Full flood storage is Elevation 840 ft NGVD29 at which time, the spillway gates are opened to regulate the reservoir level. Residents downstream and around the reservoir are encouraged to pre-plan emergency routes.",
    "riskManagementMeasures": "USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. Flood-fighting materials are stockpiled at the project and readily available for use during emergency conditions.",
